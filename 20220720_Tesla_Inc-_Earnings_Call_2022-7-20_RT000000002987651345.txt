Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2022 Q&A
Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by
Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn, and a number of other executives.
Our Q2 results were announced at about 3 PM Central Time in the update deck we
published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our
business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based
on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ
materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in
our most recent filings with the SEC.
During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one
question and one follow-up. Please use the 'Raise Hand' button to join the question
queue. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Thank you, Martin. So just as a Q2 recap, Q2 was a unique quarter for Tesla due to a
prolonged shutdown of our Shanghai factory. But in spite of all these challenges, it
was one of those strongest quarters in our history. Most importantly, in June, we
achieved production records in both Fremont and Shanghai. And as a result, we

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year. I do want to
emphasize this is obviously subject to force majeure, things outside of our control.
The past few years have been quite a few force majeures, and it's been kind of
supply chain hell for several years.
Credit to our Austin Tesla supply chain team for overcoming insanely difficult
challenges and a huge thanks to the Tesla Shanghai factory team, who sacrificed a
lot to get the factory back up and running in June and achieve a record output.
So also making good progress with production ramp with Berlin. We achieved
important milestone of a thousand cars a week in June, and we're expecting our
Giga Texas to exceed the thousand vehicle point milestone hopefully in the next few
months.
To be clear, we're currently making the cars with 2170 cells and Andrew Baglino will
address some of the 4680 questions later in this call. But it is worth emphasizing that
we have enough 2170 cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of the
year, so we're not dependent on 4680. 4680 will be important next year but it is not
important for this year.
That said, we haven't sold the second generation of manufacturing equipment for
4680 cells in Texas, and even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai,
we continue to expand capacity.
Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed FSD Beta with City Streets driving
capability to over 100,000 owners. They're very happy with the capabilities of the
system and we continue to improve it every week. We have now driven over 35
million miles with FSD Beta. That's more autonomous miles than any company we're
aware of. I think probably more than -- it might be more than any -- all other
companies combined, so -- and that mileage is growing exponentially.
With regard to manufacturing and technology, about five or six years ago, we said
we wanted to become the best manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat
counter-intuitively, to some people, what it will actually be, I think our strongest
competitive advantage. We're super pro-manufacturing here at Tesla, and in general,
we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing. And in
general, I think it is a very important thing to do. We need to make stuff and make it
efficiently and that's manufacturing.
So we've made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes. As we now show
in the shareholder deck, thanks to our -- the large castings, we make the world's
largest castings. We reduced body welding robot count by 70% per unit of capacity
in Austin and Berlin. So that's, call it, roughly a body shop that is roughly three times
smaller than what would normally be the case. And I should say, it's also lighter,
cheaper, and has superior noise vibration and harshness.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
So it's good on every level. But this journey is not over. We will bring a whole --
another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck, and
future products that we're not quite ready to talk about now, but I think will be very
exciting to unveil in the future.
Our safety team also introduced a feature that tensions seatbelts if the Vision system
detects imminent collision, which has never been done before. So you can imagine
that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact, you have very little time to
tension the seatbelt. You've got to be -- the car is still like got to be crunching to
trigger the seatbelt tensioner. But because we have Vision, we can actually see that a
collision is about to occur with 100% probability before it actually happens, and so
we can tension the seatbelts, and we can even adjust the airbag deployment
because we can see, not just feel. This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas
are now able to offer. And there's also an over the air update. So this is something
that will be in place in all cars that have at least AP3 hardware.
In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a stronger production rate than ever before. Our
team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future
platform design. We are expecting to be, still expecting to be in production with the
Cybertruck in the middle of next year, and we're very excited about that product. I
think it might actually be our best product ever. Let's see -- and FSD Beta is on track
to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year and
hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it, hopefully in
Europe and some other parts of the world.
We're hosting our AI Day in a few months. I think you will be amazed at what we're
able to show off in AI Day. So, basically, there's a tremendous amount to look
forward to in the second half of this year, and I want to thank all of our employees
and suppliers for their super hard work during these challenging times. Super
appreciated. Thank you.
Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. And Zack has some opening remarks as well.
Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, Martin. I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team on excellent
execution during the second quarter. Although our production volume reduced
sequentially due to COVID related shutdowns in Shanghai, we made substantial
progress in nearly every area of the business, and in particular, our global vehicle
production rate as we exited the quarter.
Our Fremont factory supported by our Reno team, reached new production records,
the Shanghai factory resumed full production, and our new factories in Austin and
Berlin are progressing well through their initial ramps.
Page 3 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Additionally, our energy business achieved record gross profit with the highest solar
volumes in many years. I want to personally thank the entire Tesla team, as I know
many of you are listening. You've embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of
excellence and support of our mission. I also want to thank our suppliers for their
support during another complicated quarter.
On GAAP Automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to 27.9%. The temporary
decline in Shanghai production volume meaningfully impacted margin, including
idle capacity and factory restart costs, and also had implications on the mix of
regional deliveries. Additionally, as discussed on previous calls, we are working
through the ramp inefficiencies of our new factories, which are progressing well but
have had an impact on margin as those factories come online.
While we continue to see a benefit from higher pricing flowing through, which
experienced some foreign exchange related headwinds, our cost structure continues
to experience cost increases from inflation, commodities and logistics.
The energy business progressed well in Q2 aided by alternate solar supply coming
online and progress on unit economics. Our storage business remains component
constrained on both Powerwall and Megapack, which we hope will alleviate to some
extent in the second half of the year. We are greatly appreciative of the patience and
flexibility shown by our customers, while we work through these challenges.
Within operating expenses, Austin and Berlin related start-up costs have wound
down as these factories have moved into production and their costs are now
reflected in automotive COGS. Additionally, we converted a majority of our Bitcoin
holdings to Fiat for a realized gain offset by impairment charges on the remainder of
our holdings, netting a $106 million cost to the P&L included within Restructuring
and Other. We also incurred restructuring charges related to targeted staffing
reductions.
Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. It should be mentioned that the reason we sold a bunch of Bitcoin holdings was
that we were uncertain as to when the COVID lockdowns in China would alleviate. So
it was important for us to maximize our cash position given the uncertainty of the
COVID lockdowns in China. We are certainly open to increasing our Bitcoin holdings
in future. So this should not be taken as some verdict on Bitcoin. It's just that we were
concerned about, overall liquidity of the company given the COVID shutdowns in
China, and we have not sold any of our Dogecoin.
Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yes. We still have it.
Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We still have our Dogecoin.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Despite these challenges, we were still able to achieve one of our strongest
operating margins of 14.6%.
Our free cash flows were impacted by working capital related to the Shanghai
factory shutdown. However, we expect this will show as a benefit in Q3 as our
working capital related cashflows re-stabilize.
As we look ahead and as Elon mentioned, we are positioned for a record-breaking
second half of the year. We're quite excited about this. A couple of things to keep in
mind as we progress; Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies will continue to weigh on
our margins for the balance of the year, however, the impact should reduce as we
increase ramp.
Second, as we've mentioned before, we expect to continue to see recognized global
pricing to increase as our backlog flows through. However, macroeconomic related
cost increases will also continue to be part of our story. And finally, despite losing
more builds in Q3 than expected, we're still pushing to reach 50% growth this year.
This target has become more difficult but it remains possible with strong execution,
and as Elon mentioned, no more force majeure events for the balance of the year.
Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. There were a lot of force majeure in the last several years. I think that's for sure.
Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Thank you.
Questions And Answers
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
Thank you very much. And now let's go to the questions from investors.
And the first question is, Chinese EV manufacturers seem to be doing a better job
than their Western competitors, excluding Tesla, at innovating in software and
design. How can Tesla make sure the company is staying ahead of those
manufacturers, both within China and outside of China?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, right now, the best Chinese EV manufacturer is Tesla, China. We're actually
doing the best thanks to our incredible team in China. But I have a lot of respect for
Page 5 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
the Chinese car manufacturers and EV manufacturers in particular. I think they will be
a force to be reckoned with worldwide. They're very -- they're smart and they're
hardworking and I think anyone who is not -- any company that's not as competitive
as them, will obviously suffer a market share decline. So obviously, we have a lot of
respect for the current companies in China and then their capabilities, yes.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question is, when will Tesla have a unified vector space for both
static and moving object network? Will this be a v11 or a later version? If the latter,
can you explain what makes it a difficult problem in layman terms?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay. This answer will be understood by 0.001% of the audience I think. Most people
don't know what a unified vector space would actually mean. It essentially would be,
if you can take -- if instead of knitting together static and dynamic objects in C++, if
they could be knit together at the neural net level, then you don't need to reconcile
them within C++ heuristics. That is an architecturally better way to -- that's the most
desirable outcome. It's -- I think it's probably not necessary to achieve full self-
driving, but it would be a slight improvement in the efficiency of the self-driving. And
that's certainly something we want to get to, yes, the sort of nirvana situation is, you
have surround video/auto labeling of all static and dynamic objects. And you have
then a surround video inference with spatial memory as well.
Then that's -- I mean, I think we're almost certainly there before the end of the year.
Yes, I'm not sure how many people would understand that.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Sounds good.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
But I should say also, we are also confident of improving the frame rate. As we delete
some of the legacy neural nets, we think we might be able to get to the frame rates
of 8 cameras maybe up to 36 fps, which is actually a lot of frames, considering its 8
cameras. It's certainly comfortably above 24 frames, which is basically the movie,
frame rate of movies.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question is, Elon recently tweeted about lowering prices once
inflation cools down. Can you elaborate on what do you mean by cooling down and
how aggressively the company will lower prices? More broadly, how do you think
about the order pricing long-term?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. So, since we have -- there's a quite a long wait when somebody orders our car.
In some cases, six months, in some cases it could be up to a year. We have to
Page 6 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
anticipate what the probable inflation rate is over that period of time. So, that's what
we're trying to do when we see -- when or if we see indications that the inflation rate
is declining, then we would not need to increase our car prices. It's possible that
there could be a slight decrease in car prices, but this is fundamentally dependent
on macroeconomic inflation. It's not something we control.
If I were to guess, and I wouldn't -- take this with a grain of salt. I think inflation will
decline towards the end of this year. We are certainly seeing prices of commodities
trending lower but take it with a grain of salt. This is -- making economic
prognostication is fraught with error. I don't know if you guys want to -- do you want
to say anything about it?
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah. We're certainly seeing, I mean it's kind of a whole spectrum on the battery
metal side. For example, the price of lithium has really shot up. It used to be $11 a
kilogram to more than $80 a kilogram. But you know, it's not every situation is that
bad. So it's kind of a spectrum.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Carbon steel, aluminum --
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
(Inaudible)
A - Unidentified Speaker
Carbon steel and aluminum has started trending down. We will see the benefits of it
only probably later part of this year or early next year.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. But I think that's just like -- for most commodities we're seeing a downward
trend towards the end of this year or next year. Some commodities, the pricing of
lithium is insane. I would like to once again urge entrepreneurs to enter the lithium
refining business. The mining is relatively easy, the refining is much harder. So, the --
lithium is actually a very common -- it's sort of very -- it is like lithium is pretty much
everywhere. But you have to refine the lithium into battery grade lithium carbonate
and lithium hydroxide, which has the extremely high purity. So, it is basically like
minting money right now. It is like software margins in lithium processing right now.
So, I would really like to encourage once again entrepreneurs to enter the lithium
refining business. You can't lose. It's a license to print money.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question is, you made the right economic call before most on
inflation when you diversified into Bitcoin. It has since shown it's not much of a
hedge in the real world test the last few months. How do you think about it as an
asset over long-term and what do you need to see to change your view?
Page 7 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, Tesla is a -- Tesla's goal is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. We're
not really -- crypto currency is a sideshow to the sideshow. So we're not -- of course,
cryptocurrency is not something we think about a lot. We think a lot about scaling
production and accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, which the record heat
waves around the Earth serve to emphasize the urgency of that transition. So that is
what we're trying to do, is make electric vehicles and solar and stationary storage
battery packs. But the three pillars of a sustainable energy future which is like solar
and wind for energy generation, stationary battery packs for storage of the solar and
wind energy because of its intermittency, and then electric vehicles, the third pillar.
And if those three things are solved, we have a sustainable future for civilization. And
the fundamental good of Tesla and the reason we're doing this, so certainly my
primary motivation here is to have the day of sustainable energy come sooner. That's
our goal. We're neither here or there on cryptocurrency.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question's on 4680. Elon noted that 4680 plus structural pack is
not yet optimized. Can you please share the general path of 4680 instructional packs
in terms of cost efficiencies when compared to the traditional 2170 pack? Will cost
improvements be mostly due to scale or do we need to solve some technical issues?
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. Do you want to do the architecture?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. So structural pack where we get dual use of the battery cells as structure and
as energy storage, in the same that an aircraft gets dual use of the wing as a fuel tank
and as a wing, is I think unequivocally, from a physics standpoint, the superior
architecture, so it's the A architecture. Now, because it is new, we will start off getting
aspirationally a C within an A architecture. But the potential is there for to get
radically better and then unequivocally better than a battery pack which is carried
like a sack of potatoes. So --
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. And we've gained the perspective through putting our first structural pack in
production, that, it is actually the A architecture.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Like, before we did that, it was a hypothesis that was backed with a lot of modeling
and first principles and analyses. And now we've actually built in and more confident
in that assertion.
Page 8 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. So exactly. So the structural pack, even the C and A architecture is beating the
non-structural pack. And so over time, it will, with further refinement, be substantially
superior to a car that is carrying a battery pack as though it is cargo. And this is, like I
said, it's very, very much, very analogous to the early days of aviation where fuel
tanks were initially carried like cargo until they realized actually you should get dual
use of a fuel tank as a wing and as a fuel tank. And that makes the planes lighter and
better. And the same is true of electric vehicles.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
And on cost improvements, are they due to scale or about solving technical issues?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Both.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah. It's obviously both.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. Really the two things that improve costs are economies of scale and core
technology.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. I think technical issues is not the right --
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Technical issues like -- (Multiple Speakers)
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Getting to the optimal design, right? Like you always start with some excess, some
people might call it fad, but that's not really what we think it is initially, it's like you
don't know how lean you can get it, until you've done it a couple of times.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean there's some platonic ideal of the perfect product where the atoms --
you have exactly the right atoms and they're in exactly the right position, and you
asymptotically approach this platonic ideal. But it takes a lot of effort over time to
figure out actually what is the platonic ideal and then actually gradually approach
that.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Page 9 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yeah. I mean you might need to create a new alloy, then you need to figure out how
to cast it.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Then you need to ramp the casting machine of the new alloy, as an example.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We did.
A - Unidentified Speaker
We have done it for rotors, we have done it for weight castings, so like, yeah, it does
take time.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
But constant improvement is something we're used to here and it's something like
we've done with our vehicles and their designs since the beginning. I mean, even we
were talking a couple of weeks ago, like the first version of the front casting that we
made that went into the early vehicles is like --
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Model -- Do you mean Model S stage?
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
No, I'm talking about like our first Model Y.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Oh, yeah. We've -- since we've ordered more dies because we need more dies for
more production. We've saved like 4 or 5 kilos of mass just in die iteration and that's
something we do at Tesla like quite regularly and we'll continue to do. So, we're not
happy with a C, like maybe we're at a C+ now but we got to keep going to B-minus
on the rear casting. But this will transfer for improvement with the casting. So the
casting is already way better than -- the rear body casting is already way better than
the way it was done in the past where you've got 120 different parts that are welded
together or bonded together with different alloys and then you have to put sealant
in between all the various parts for water ingress and noise. So we're already way
better than that with current casting, but there's still a lot of opportunities to reduce
the mass of the casting and also extend the casting to include more parts, as well as
adapt the rest of the vehicle for the fact that there's a casting.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Page 10 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yes, I was going to say the same thing, right? Like we're not just evaluating the pack
in isolation either. It's the pack plus the body, the integration, do we have mass in the
right places, we have the cast in the right places in only just the right amount. And I
think we've gone through one iteration. We're going to do another one with
Cybertruck. And we're taking the learnings and doing. The next version hopefully is a
B-plus in the A architecture. That's certainly a target.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question is, how do you feel the progress of FSD is going? And
does Andrej Karpathy's leaving any significant impact on timelines or potential
progress?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, since Andrej was writing all the code by himself, naturally, things have come to
a grinding halt. And so the irony -- so Andrej is also -- I man we have tremendous
amount of respect for Andrej. He's decided to -- I think he wants to contribute more
to, I think, core AI at an academic level and get back to coding individually. So -- but
we've got a team of about 120 people in our software AI group that are extremely
talented. And I think we will have -- I'm highly confident we will solve full self-driving
and it still seems to be this year. I know people, they're like, he always says that, but it
does seem to be -- it does seem as though we are converging on solving full self-
driving this year.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question is, how is the 4680 ramp going and is Giga Texas
producing cells yet?
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. So we are making progress on 4680, but right now, as Elon mentioned, we are
leveraging supplier cells, which we have in sufficient quantity to ramp Texas and
Berlin. We expect to ramp total 4680 production to exceed 1K per week by the end
of the year, hopefully before -- well before. In Q2, at Kato, we fully automated power
conveyance for the drying of electrode tool there, unlocking major increases in
production and improvements in yields. Since March, because of that, Kato output
has grown 35% month-over-month each month since, and yields throughout the
factory are already at targets in most areas and trending in that direction and in a few
others.
We did feed learnings from Fremont cell and pack lines, the Texas and Berlin there,
it's a carbon copy. Cell design was revved to unlock higher performance and
manufacturing simplicity. Manufacturing lines were further integrated and we in-
sourced additional content. For these reasons, there are some new ramp challenges
to overcome in Texas and Berlin. Specific to Texas, last quarter, cell equipment was
fully installed and commissioned and we produced our first commissioning car sets
of cells through the end of the line. Our target for Texas is to begin production in this
quarter and aim for Texas to be capable of exceeding Kato weekly output before the
end of this year.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you very much. The next question is on 4680 as well, but I think Drew
has covered everything that was in the next question. So the following question is,
with regards to the ramp of production in Austin and Berlin, how is the situation with
regards to supply of semiconductors, battery cells, and other components? How
about cost inflation impacting profitability of these other plans?
I can take that. So Tesla procures about 1,600 unique pieces of silicon from 43
semiconductor companies. So with a portfolio of that size, there are always
challenges. Things are more stable on the latest generation chips. We still see some
tightness in the older generation semiconductors, especially in the analog and
mixed signal space. But we have line of sight to solve for the volumes being
contemplated for both Austin and Berlin.
And on the cell front, like Elon mentioned, we have a comfortable margin thanks to
record output from our partners and have line of sight that matches the planned
output from both factories. We've grown cell production significantly on a 12-month
rolling basis and have long-term contracts with all our partners for key battery
metals. So we don't see any major problems for the components, of course, barring
unforeseen COVID-related shutdowns.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Just to add on the profitability part of the question. Q2 was our largest increase we
had over the last handful of quarters on an inflation and commodity-related
increases to our cars. It's fairly evenly spread across the factories, given common
suppliers or common issues that impact the broad supply chain. So I think I had
mentioned before that we have been seeing increases over the course of last year. It
ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again and the rate of increase was more in Q2.
So as we look through to the end of the year, what we're seeing is, we don't think the
inflation-related increases in Q3 will be as big as Q2. But as Elon has mentioned,
there is uncertainty on pricing here.
And we don't have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component
of cost because we do have some contracts in place. But there are some spot buys
as well and some contracts being renegotiated. So we're managing it with pricing
and in partnership with our suppliers, but it does continue to be something that is
impacting our financials.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you very much. And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be
officially available?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We're hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.

Great. Thank you very much. And now let's go to analyst questions.
The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Pierre, feel
free to unmute yourself.
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to ask like a question on the 4680
and the structural battery pack, and I'd love to understand where you stand on the
technology and efficiency and energy density roadmap that you described at the
Battery Day. So what I'm trying to understand is, where do you stand on the
architecture of the battery cell itself? How much silicon do you have in it? How much
energy improvement have you achieved already so far? And the reason why I'm
asking -- sorry.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Go ahead.
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
And the reason why I'm asking that is because you have like very smart guys on
Twitter who shared experience about trying to fully empty a Model Y from Texas,
from Austin, and noticing behaviors and like recharging behavior that suggested that
maybe these cars had like very, very high mileage, very high range, and were like
artificially limited in range in software. So I'm just kind of trying to understand how
much of an edge you're building at the moment with the 4680 and the structural
battery pack on range.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. Let me just try to provide like a super straightforward answer. Like, as Elon
mentioned before, our priority was really on simplicity and scale during the initial
4680 and structural battery ramp. So we weren't like putting all the bells and whistles
in from day one because if so, we would be sort of suffering under a string of serious
miracles that we would need to achieve to get going. But as we attain the
manufacturing goals that we've stated, hit the ramp that we need to hit next year, we
are certainly planning to layer in new material technologies and higher-range
structural packs, like we're not like holding back goodies for some rainy day or
something like that.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Maybe another way of putting it is that the -- our focus right now is on the
dozens of little issues that inhibit the production ramp of the 4680. Some of the
more challenging ones have been feeding the anode and cathode material because
we're using this revolutionary dry electrode process. But when something is
revolutionary, it's a lot of unknowns that have to be resolved. So and we're confident
of resolving those unknowns but it's very difficult. It's -- yes, we're making rapid
Page 13 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
progress on that front. So the first order of business is really get the basics right, get
to high volume and high reliability and then very rapidly iterate within that to
enhance the energy density and reduce the cost of the cell.
Totally agree, yeah.
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
Okay.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I'd say we are highly confident of a good outcome. It's -- the exact counterpoint to
that is perhaps is of some debate but the outcome is not.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. And specific to the dry process, we made a major advance this past quarter in
Kato that the team is really excited about, and congrats to the team for achieving
that.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
But I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our
suppliers of battery cells. The Tesla battery cell production is in addition to what our
suppliers can do. And we want our suppliers to grow their battery output as fast as
they possibly can, and that goes for the entire supply chain. The fundamental rate
limiter for both transitioning to a sustainable energy, is how fast can you grow the
amount of battery output per year. This is the fundamental rate limiter for transition
to sustainability because you need the batteries for two of the pillars of sustainability,
the stationary storage and for vehicles. So, yeah.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. And I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies
are not necessarily scalable. I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I've
seen. And so like focusing on them is a distraction from the mission, like it really is
how do we scale as fast as possible. And we're taking these risks that we've
discussed at Battery Day and our plan is as we de-risk them and they are successful,
we want to bring them back to our partners so that they can go faster too, because
that's all on the mission, right, like how do we accelerate.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
People often ask me, people often ask me is some breakthrough needed in battery
technology for the world to transition to sustainability? The answer is, no. Even if
there was zero technology breakthroughs, literally zero from where the technology is
right now, we could fully transition Earth to sustainable energy. But the issue is very
much the rate at which the entire supply chain, from mining to refining to cell
production, how fast can that grow. It's growing fast, but the faster it grows, the faster
we transition to a sustainable energy economy.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
This is actually a great -- exactly where my follow-up is. So Elon, you always mention,
this 50% per annum sustainable growth target that you guys have. And so, my
question here is, when we see like the difficulty regarding the commodities, raw
materials' swinging prices, I'm kind of wondering, as you are planning for this 50%
per annum growth, if we stand today over the next five to ten years, how much of
that do you feel you've secured through your work at entering into long-term
contracts and things like that?
And you were calling for entrepreneurs to go into the lithium business. And so does
that mean you don't have enough lithium secured to grow 50% per annum over
multiple years and what's -- how much of that is secured today, and how fast can you
improve that basically?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, I think it's very difficult to predict anything ten years from now. I hope
civilization is still around, frankly. I would count that as a win.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
I think it's not that funny.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, exactly. Hopefully, we haven't had World War III by then.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Or the earth doesn't burn down.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. So the -- we do see constraints in refining of the materials necessary for lithium
ion batteries. I do want to emphasize this as -- it is not due to a scarcity of the raw
material. In the case of lithium, lithium is one of the most common elements on
Earth. It's pretty much everywhere. But refining of the lithium into ultra-high purity
battery-grade lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate is quite difficult and it
requires a massive amount of machinery and it's a hard thing to scale. It was also
difficult to create the anode and cathode. I think -- my guess is, maybe two-thirds of
batteries will be iron phosphate or maybe iron phosphate with some manganese
and there's plenty of -- there's a ridiculous amount of iron. I mean, in fact, Earth is -- a
little bit of trivia. Someone says, what is Earth made of more than anything else? Iron.
Iron is the number one ingredient of Earth by mass. Number 2 is oxygen.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah, which is wild.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Page 15 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yeah. Basically rust. We've stuck them together. We're a rust ball. That's roughly --
that's almost two-thirds of Earth, I think is rust. We are like a rusty ball bearing with a
little bit of other stuff. So -- but plenty of lithium. So anyway, there's not like a
shortage of materials.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean -- but the other thing on the LFP thing is that it isn't just that there's
more access to material that way. The actual refining process is less capital intensive
to make a good LFP cathode. And so, there's -- it's not just scalable on the resource
side, it's scalable on the refining side.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Absolutely. To be clear, there's no fundamental barrier here. It's simply a rate
question. Like, at what rate can you scale production? And I think we're seeing a very
rapid increase in battery production and in the whole supply chain. If you were to say
today, what are concerns that appears down the road? I would say one of the
concerns is the machinery to refine the critical ingredients of lithium ion cells. So the
lithium itself, and then the cathode, which I said -- like I said, be mostly iron
phosphate, perhaps some manganese. I think almost all stationary storage will be
iron phosphate and then you really just need nickel chemistry for long-range
vehicles like aircraft and that kind of thing.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. The other thing I would say is, we are working with our suppliers to ramp their
capability as quickly as possible. And it's not like we have a problem in the next year
or two to, specifically to your question. But when we look ten years out, yeah, we
need to do more to accelerate the growth and that is why we are making our own
investments, like we are building a cathode facility here in Texas, that still is going up,
you can see it in the flyovers. We're working on a lithium refining activity as well
ourselves because the best way to learn how to accelerate something is to do it
yourself. So these are the things we're doing to move it all forward.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean if our suppliers don't solve these problems, then we will.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
Emmanuel, go ahead and unmute yourself.
Q - Emmanuel Rosner {BIO 16323493 <GO>}
Yeah. Thank you so much. I have a question on your vehicle demand and then a
quick follow-up on supply. First, on the demand side, are you seeing any sort of
pressure in the orderbook or the pace of new order or any sort of like slowdown as a
result of the pressures that the consumer is experiencing? Are you worried about it
in light of your view of the risks to the economy that I think you expressed, Elon?
Page 16 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, right now, our problem is very much production. So we've long leads on, as
anyone can tell if they order our car, if you order Model Y, it will arrive sometime next
year. So this is clearly not an issue for many months for us. Our problem is
overwhelmingly that of production. So --
Q - Emmanuel Rosner {BIO 16323493 <GO>}
Okay.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Okay. Maybe just two things to add. Specifically on your question, are we seeing a
macroeconomic impact on our demand? Not that I can tell. Maybe a little, but --
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Some maybe, but it's --
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
But it's not material. The second thing, to Elon's point about backlogs, we have a
very long runway with very long lead times here. I mean, certainly, the world is
uncertain, and we'll have to see where things go with commodity prices, how quickly
we're ramping production, what the state of the road looks like at some point next
year. But the demand is not something we spend really any time talking about.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. And I think it's -- maybe just once again worth mentioning the -- that there is
difference between value for money and fundamental affordability because
sometimes people say, well, if you got all this demand, why don't you just raise the
price to some -- double the price or something. And this is usually expressed by
somebody who is rich. So if -- but there's -- even if you rail value for money to infinity,
if somebody does not -- if consumers do not have enough money to buy it, even a
product where the desirability is real to infinity, they basically cannot buy it. So this is
why you cannot just raise prices to some arbitrarily high level because you pass the
affordability boundary and then the demand falls off the cliff.
So I do feel like we've raised our prices or we raised our prices quite a few times.
They're frankly at embarrassing levels. But we've also had a lot of supply chain and
production shocks and as -- we've got crazy inflation. So I'm hopeful this is not a
promise or anything, but I'm hopeful that at some point we can reduce the prices a
little bit.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. Emmanuel, do you have a follow-up?
Q - Emmanuel Rosner {BIO 16323493 <GO>}
Page 17 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yeah. My follow-up was actually on the supply side. So it was very encouraging to
see that you're quantifying your current installed capacity at basically already in
excess of 1.9 million units installed currently. How quickly do you think that you can
fill that capacity?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, I mean, we -- I think we've got a good chance of exiting this year at 40,000
vehicles a week.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean our internal plans are to have the capacity utilized by the end of the
year. It takes time to ramp there. It will be a challenge. There's a lot that needs to
happen to get there, but that's what we're working on.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. We've had many 30,000-car weeks already, so I think a 40,000-car week is
within reach by the end of this year.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Shanghai and Fremont, as we said last month, were record production and they're
really firing better, doing really well. But then also Berlin are coming on strong.
Theoretically, they also had record quarters last quarter. And if we ramp them to the
capacity shown in the deck, by the end of this year, we'll be at that rate.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. There's always a lot of uncertainty and like -- the production looks like an S-
curve, and that intermediate part of the S-curve is, it's very difficult to predict that
with high certainty. But the end part of the S-curve, you can say, I think you can have
a lot more certainty. And so that's why I'm confident we'll get to 5,000 cars a week in
Austin and Berlin by the end of this year or early next year and probably but not
certainly, 10,000 cars a week at both locations by the end of next year.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Colin, go
ahead please.
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Thanks so much guys. Could you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy around
FSD? And as you get closer to this full functionality rolling out and the increased
cycle times, how you see that evolving through the balance of this year and into
2023?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Page 18 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yeah. We will increase the price of FSD sometime later this year. I think probably just
before we go to Y beta. The Y beta is anyone who wants to use the beta software
with all the caveats associated with that can use it, then it would make sense to
increase the price of FSD. The value of FSD is, I think, extremely high and not well
understood by most people. It is basically currently ridiculously cheap, assuming
FSD materializes, which it will.
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Great. And then -- sorry to belabor a little bit on this battery materials side. But in
terms of some of the suppliers and the contaminants, can you be a little bit more
specific around some of the elements that you guys see in some of your supply
chain that can prove troublesome on yields for the 4680s, particularly around lithium
and potential contaminants in either hydroxide or the carbonates that you guys end
up seeing real issues with as you move into production?
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. I don't really think we have anything to comment on the purity specs of lithium
on this call right now, yeah.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. The contaminants from the 4680 are not a factor, this is not an issue.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you very much. The next question comes from Tony Sacconaghi from
Bernstein. Tony, go ahead please.
Q - Toni Sacconaghi {BIO 3056875 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two as well. In response to the
question around demand, I think, Zach, you said maybe a little, and Elon, you said
maybe some indication that you might see some pressure on demand. And I'm
wondering, if that is really just speculation or whether there's any empirical data that
you saw in the last month, whether it'd be cancellations or order lead times that led
you to make that comment. I think anecdotally, if you squint, the lead times have
gotten a little lower over the last four months in both China and the US. That's really
the only visibility investors have. So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on
whether that's really just you're sort of anticipating there could be some impact
because of high prices or whether there is something anecdotally or quantitatively
that you could point to, please?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I mean, I think we've said this now for many years, and I know it has proven true.
Tesla does not have a demand problem, we have a production problem. And we've
almost always had it. It's a very rare exception but it's always been a production
problem. I think that will remain the case.
Page 19 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
So there's a denominator and a numerator, and like, if you increase production.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, absolutely. As we increase production, more demand is needed obviously.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
No, it's more just like you can't look at the backlog and state much about demand
because we're doing a lot on the other side to change the production.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We're trying to make the backlog lower, not longer.
A - Unidentified Speaker
We're building factories and building more companies.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We don't want a long backlog. That's annoying. It'd be like go to a restaurant and
you order a burger and you have to wait 3 hours and like, that's annoying. You want
to get your burger right away. Same with the car. So we want that lead times to
reduce.
Q - Toni Sacconaghi {BIO 3056875 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you. Now I was just trying to follow up on the fact that you both said that
maybe you were seeing demand be impacted a little bit, and that was the spirit of
the question. Maybe I can --
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We don't have like -- like because we see daily orders from around the world for our
cars, it's actually -- it is like a mood barometer of people's confidence in the
economy. But one can't read too much into it because things can vary a great deal
from one day to the next. Consumer sentiment is all over the map. So it's -- manage
price, frankly, you know -- so -- we have so much excess demand. That is really just
not an issue for us. It might be an issue for some other companies, but it is not an
issue for us.
Q - Toni Sacconaghi {BIO 3056875 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you. Elon, I'm just wondering, a question for you. Tesla has obviously
changed dramatically in the last three years, from near life or death to a company
with consistent cash flow and industry-leading margins. I'm wondering if you can
comment on your personal role in the company and whether you see that changing
in terms of your role or your commitment and time spent at the company over the
next three or four years. I think you said a few calls ago, you wouldn't be on calls
Page 20 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
unless there's something unusual and you've been on every call since then. I'm
wondering how you think about --
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We did a lot of unusual things, let's face it. If there's only good news, I won't be on
the call. But if you have like a tough situation like COVID shutdowns in China, then I
think I'll be on the call relatively speaking, if there's bad news. And if all we have is
good news, then I won't be on the call. So I'm committed to the long term -- I mean,
I'll work at Tesla as long as I can usefully advance the cause of sustainability and
autonomy.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Fantastic. Thank you very much. The next question comes from William Stein. Please
go ahead and unmute yourself.
Q - William Stein {BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Elon, in the past, you've given
some assessment as to the likelihood that you can achieve success in some of the
more interesting AI-oriented efforts, not only FSD but also Dojo and Optimus.
Perhaps you can give an updated view on those.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, I don't want to steal thunder from AI Day, though I think we'll have some
exciting news on AI Day that I think will be further ahead than probably most people
think. But I don't want to -- I'd love to answer you but I think we'll leave that
excitement for AI Day.
Q - William Stein {BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Okay. And perhaps a follow-up if I can. We've heard a lot from others and certainly to
some degree from you all about the shortages in semiconductors, in particular. We
have seen some big, important customers of that type of product decide to sort of
leverage the ecosystems that exist to make some of their own in those categories.
I'm wondering to what degree you're doing that. That's outside of Dojo in terms of
the, I guess, on the inference side, you're certainly doing that in the car, but what
about sort of the more mundane areas like microcontrollers and the like, is there any
internal effort to improve supply chain and maybe improve other performance
aspects?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, there's a lot we've done. We've been working with our supplier side. We don't
currently intend to make chips ourselves. We don't think there will be a need to
make chips, but we have been working closely with a number of suppliers. Actually
just met with one of our key supplier CEOs right before this call. We had a great
meeting. They're going to make major investments in some of the critical chips and
components that we need in the car. So -- and I'd actually like to take a moment to
thank our key suppliers once again for supporting us through difficult times and they
Page 21 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
really went above and beyond to support us. So to all our suppliers out there, thanks
very much.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. And I guess just maybe we don't talk about it very often, but we do have a lot of
custom silicon in the vehicle already. Microcontrollers, yes, some; battery
management, yes, some; power electronics, yes, some. So we try to go after where
there is actually a technical advantage and in the future, I think we're going to look at
where there is a supplier have been so that's an advantage.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Even now where the supply chain issues with our Tier 1s and Tier 2s, kind of rush and
get into it with us on the engineering side when we find solutions, whether it's
alternative chips or changing the entire structure of this pack to make it work. And I
think that's an advantage we have that many other OEs just simply cannot.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think Tesla is as much a software company as it is a hardware company. And so one
of the ways that we've been able to address supply chain issues on the chip front is
by rewriting our software to be able to use different chips or in some cases, achieve
dual use of a single chip, which is even better. And actually, quite frankly, the chip
shortage has served as a forcing function for us to reduce the number of chips in the
car.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Simplify.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, turns out we had more chips than we needed. So -- but it's a testament to our
software team that we are able to roll a new chip into the car, write a whole new
batch of software for that chip without interrupting production.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. And our goal is as we mature and scale the platforms to integrate more
functionality into fewer chips, like that is the way that it's gone with laptops and
phones. It's going that way in cars. And we're trying to do that wherever it makes
sense to do it as quickly as we can.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
From a supply chain standpoint, do we -- what do you think about the chips and
whatnot?
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Page 22 of 23
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-07-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yes. I think -- I mean, from a high level, instead of designing and building our own
microcontrollers, we're partnering with key partners that understand the architectural
requirements and they'll take the specs and design something for us. We've done
that, to your point, in the battery sensing space. We've got some application-specific
ICs. But yes, integrating, reducing the number of components, it's a mix of supply
chain issue, but it also makes the reliability of the end product better because there's
less failure points. So that's always been the mantra.
A - Unidentified Speaker
And at times, we've also got the wafer level and try to consume less to achieve the
same functionality. So that's something also that we've been looking at in some of
the constrained modules that we have faced in the last six months.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
That's good.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Fantastic. Well, thank you very much. Appreciate all of your questions. Unfortunately,
this is all the time we have this quarter, and we will speak to you again in three
months' time. Thank you very much, and goodbye.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
