Before we jump into Q&A, Zach will have some opening remarks.
Zach?
Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, Martin.
Just to start off here, Q1 was a challenging, but extremely successful quarter for the
company. Despite numerous supply interruptions, including shutdowns at our
Shanghai factory and nearby suppliers due to COVID, we have continued making
progress and achieved our best ever vehicle deliveries.
Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new financial records, including revenue,
gross margins, operating margin, and bottom-line profitability. GAAP automotive
gross margin reached 32.9%, and for the first time, exceeded 30% when excluding
regulatory credits. Higher pricing continues to positively impact our financials as we
make progress delivering cars in our growing backlog.
Note that for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long, thus cars
delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than
cars being ordered today.
Our per unit vehicle costs increased as well. Inflation, raw material prices, expedites,
and logistics costs, continues to impact our cost structure. Factory shutdowns also
occurred with little to no notice, hence we were unable to take action to plan those
interruptions in a cost-efficient manner. Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift
towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y. We also recognized a one-
time benefit of $288 million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in
the U.S. CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined
compared to the same period last year.
The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions more
severely than the vehicle business. Our storage products are in need of chip supply
and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components for our
solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue,
lower stock-based comp expense and other items. As a result of our ongoing
improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over
19%.
Note that commissioning cost for our factories are in R&D as Berlin started
production in late March, and Austin in early April. These costs will be in automotive
COGS going forward given these factories are now producing customer-sellable
cars.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet, were impacted by working
capital related to lower than planned production. Additionally, we have reduced our
debt, excluding product financing to nearly zero.
Looking ahead, in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2. First,
we've lost about a month of built volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to
COVID-related shutdowns. Production is resuming at limited levels and we're
working to get back to full production as quickly as possible. This will impact total
build and delivery volume in Q2.
Second, as I've mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps and
thus those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2.
Third, we do have higher ASPs in our backlog, which will help to offset some of these
headwinds. We continue to drive towards further strengthening of our financials in
the second half of the year, and believe our 50% or above growth rate remains
achievable for the year.
I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers, and our new customers
for a great first quarter.
Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. And Elon has some opening remarks as well.
Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach's, but it's maybe worth
repeating.
Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels, reaching the highest deliveries,
profit and an operating margin of 19%. This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many
logistics challenges, and an overall a difficult quarter.
So, I really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and an
output despite many, many difficult headwinds. And especially the Tesla China team
and our Shanghai factory, they really had significant challenges due to the COVID
shutdowns, and nonetheless, have been able to output a tremendous number of
high-quality vehicles. And we're already back up and running with the Shanghai
factory.
So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a 50% growth in vehicle production in 2022
versus '21. I think we actually have a reasonable shot at a 60% increase over last year.
So, let's see -- obviously, we have production, as people know, with Giga Berlin and
Giga Texas in the past few months. So, we've two fantastic factories with great teams,
and they are ramping rapidly. With new factories, the initial ramp always looks small,
Page 3 of 25
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
but it grows exponentially. So -- but I have -- we have very high confidence in the
teams of both factories, and we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but would like
to see it growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this
year.
So, we're also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening,
which is a dedicated robotaxi, that's highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it
would not have steering wheel or pedals. And there are a number of other
innovations around it that I think are quite exciting, that it's fundamentally optimized
for -- it's trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per
kilometer, accounting everything. And so, it's, I think, it would be a very powerful
product, where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024.
So, I think that that really will be a massive driver of Tesla's growth. And we remain
on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
Let's see. So, it's basically -- once again, I'd like to thank the Tesla employees for their
hard work, but also I'd like to thank our suppliers, who have really gone the extra
mile. They -- we have an amazing supplier group and I want to say heartfelt thanks to
the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to
keep the factories running.
And we're really at the early stage of our journey. We only crossed 1 million units in
the past 12 months, recently, and we are -- we aspire to head to 20 million units a
year. So, we're basically 5% along the way for -- towards our goal. And -- but we are
growing very, very rapidly year-over-year and remain confident of exceeding 50%
annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next years, I
mean -- so, yes.
And then, there's of course, Optimus, which -- I was surprised that people did not
realize the magnitude of the Optimus robot program. This -- The importance of
Optimus will become apparent in the coming years. Those who are insightful or
listen carefully, will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the
car business, worth more than FSD. That's my firm belief.
So, and then of course, insurance is growing well. We expect to address the part
shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar, so we expect batteries
and solar to also grow well this year, and basically future is very exciting. I've never
been more optimistic or excited about Tesla's future than I am right now.
Thank you.
Questions And Answers
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
Page 4 of 25
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Thank you very much. Let's go through the first investor question. And the first
investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD timelines with not optimal
accuracy. We love his optimism for 2022 release, but is there any data Tesla can
share with investors to help them make their own conclusions on progress being
made, interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. Well, with respect to Full Self-Driving, of any technology development I've ever
been involved in, I've never really seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems
like we're going to break through, but we don't, as I've seen in Full Self-Driving. And
ultimately, what it comes down to is that, to solve Full Self-Driving you actually have
to solve real-world artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved. And
the whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes. And so, actually,
when you think about it, in order to solve a Full Self-Driving, we have to solve neural
nets and cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds
humans.
And I think we will achieve that this year. The best way to reach your own assessment
is to join the Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta program, where we have over 100,000
people right now enrolled in that program, and we expect to broaden that
significantly this year. So, that's my recommendation, is join the Full Self-Driving Beta
program and experience it for yourself, and take note of the rate of improvement
with every release. And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks. So -- and
you'll see a little bit of two steps forward, one step back. But overall, the rate of
improvement is incredibly quick. So, that's my recommendation for reaching your
own assessment is to literally try it.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. And the second question is, how much of an impact will the production
shutdown in Shanghai have in Q2? What is the timeline for localizing the Model 3 in
Europe, or will newer models be prioritized in Berlin?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, the -- we did lose a lot of important days of production. And because there are
sort of upstream supplier challenges where a lot of suppliers have also lost many
days of production. But our Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a
vengeance. So, I think, notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see
record output per week from Giga Shanghai this quarter, albeit we are missing a
couple of weeks. So, that means that most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be
similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower, but it's also possible we may pull a rabbit out of
the hat and be slightly higher. But it's really, call it, roughly on par. But then Q3 and
Q4 it'll be substantially higher. So, it seems likely that we'll be able to produce over
1.5 million cars this year, is my -- that's my best guess.
And then Model 3. It's important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the
least amount of complexity and variation, which is why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas
are focused on the Model Y. It's -- from the point in which you have a factory
complete and you're making a small number of units, to the point where it's
Page 5 of 25
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
producing high-quality vehicles in volume, is sort of 9-months to 12-months from
start of production. So, now hopefully, we're getting better at that ramp, so maybe
it's a little less. But to get to sort of the 5,000 a week level, has typically taken us
around 12 months from start of production. Yes.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have,
measured roughly in percentage of cost of goods sold for example, in a given
quarter versus one to two years out, both direct and indirect? Separately, how do
you think about price increases versus prioritizing higher mix vehicles going
forward?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe
we're being unreasonable about increasing the prices of our vehicles, given that we
had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our vehicles is quite long.
And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year.
So, our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics
cost growth that we're aware of and believe will happen over the next 6-months to
12-months. So, that's why we have the price increases today because the car ordered
today will arrive, in some cases, a year from now. So, we have a very long wait list,
and we're obviously not demand-limited, we are production-limited by -- very much
production-limited.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
And raw material exposure?
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yes. Just to add to what Elon is saying, there's different ways to calculate raw material
exposure. I think the simple way, we estimate we're around 10% to 15% of our cost
structure exposed to raw materials. And just to clarify a couple of things on that. So,
we've been experiencing increases in cost in general, but also raw materials for a
number of quarters now. That pace picked up in Q1, so last quarter. And what we're
seeing for Q2 is slightly higher than that as well. And as indices move, it doesn't
impact us immediately or directly. In some cases, we have contracts with suppliers.
But then as those contracts expire, we have to renegotiate them so that there can be
a lag.
In some cases, our contracts do directly reflect movement in commodity prices or
raw material prices. But the timing in which that Tesla pays for that, has a lag
associated with it as well based on the contract. And so, to Elon's point, what we're
trying to do here, because it's quite an unprecedented situation of raw material
movement and all of these various lags and uncertainty around renegotiating
contracts, is we're trying to anticipate where things will go and make sure that the
pricing that we have put in place at the time that those raw material cost increases hit
us that they align, and that the company can remain financially healthy in various
scenarios as we look out over the next four quarters.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you very much. The next question is, why does Tesla continue to fight
dealership laws on a state-by-state basis versus taking it federal? Separately, why
isn't Tesla using an 800-volt architecture in its vehicles? What are the advantages or
disadvantages?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. So, from Tesla's standpoint, obviously, we'd like to have federal legislation that
allows direct sales in all states, but we have not seen willingness on the part of the
Congress to enact such laws that would override a variety of state laws. So
unfortunately, we have to fight it on a state-by-state basis. And Drew, do you want to
answer the 800-volt question?
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes, sure. On the 800-volt thing, yes, so it's really a case-by-case thing. For the
smaller platform vehicles like 3 and Y, there's some wins and losses with 800 volts,
not everything is better. And so, we look at that platform, and we're not like ignoring
the reality that you can go to a higher voltage, but there's nothing really encouraging
us to do so on that platform. It's really about mass and power. And as you look at
bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Let me just quantify that --
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Basically, our estimate is that going from 400 to 800 volts might save $100.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yep.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's not really moving the needle.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And you're changing many things.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, but --
Page 7 of 25
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
The charging infrastructure all the way through the entire vehicle system --
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
-- to get maybe $100.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, exactly. So -- I mean, in the U.S. you've got 110-volts household power or voltage.
And then, in Europe, most households you have like sort of 220. But really, it doesn't
make that much of a difference, and appliances work pretty much as well in, say,
Europe as they do in the U.S.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yep.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So, there's some -- the advantages are small and the cost is high. Like I said, like
long-term, like years from now, is it -- will it make sense to probably move to an 800-
volt architecture, probably. But it really needs a very big vehicle volume to pay for
the cost of changing from 400 to 800 volts. And then, Drew, do you want to
continue to with it?
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
I was just going to say that 100 volts is also kind of like a spreadsheet exercise, right?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
$100.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Sorry, $100, it's roughly like a spreadsheet exercise, like you have to get through the
full program to the end to see that maybe it's been whittled away to $50 or less.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
On bigger vehicles, where you're talking about higher power on the charging side
or higher power from the battery to the power electronics or you need more torque,
Page 8 of 25
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
so the current requirements go up, there's a little bit more semiconductor and actual
like conductor savings of going to the higher voltage. And so, we do consider that
for Semi and Cybertruck. But for the 3/Y platform where we've got everything
running and the benefit is questionably small --
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. It's basically zero for robotaxi.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. For robotaxi, yes, it doesn't make sense here. So --
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
No, sorry, this as such -- yeah, go ahead.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Sounds good.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay, let's go to the next question. Next question is, how are the current 4680s
performing versus expectation set during the Battery Day in terms of expected range
increase and dollars per kilowatt hour?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. We're working in all the areas we shared on Battery Day, and we have sort of
consistent progress across all of those areas towards achieving the five-year cost
trajectory goals for the cost within our control. But we do not control all of the
commodity costs, so that's an exception I needed to call out.
Similar to Model 3, it will take us several years to get rate and yields to the point
where everything that we've discussed is achieved. Our priority was on simplicity
and scale during our initial 4680 and structural battery ramps. And as we attain our
manufacturing goals, we will layer in new material technologies we are developing
and higher-range structural pack revisions.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think maybe, in a nutshell, I think it probably is fair to say that 4680 structural pack
will be competitive with the best alternatives later this year. And we think we'll
exceed the best alternatives next year.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Page 9 of 25
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yes. I mean, we have some good existing proofs, right? Like we've built the facility
here in Texas, like we know how much we spent on capital equipment in the facility.
And it's more than 5x less than prior technology installations. So, we're saving huge
on CapEx, on utilities and personnel. We know what those loads are and how many
people are needed to run what is basically in a highly automized factory. And we
have massive reductions in both of those. So, like the cost model is well understood.
It's really about rate and yield, which will come in time, as Elon said, over the course
of this year and next.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question is, how does Tesla plan to secure raw materials
required to scale to extreme size?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. So, this is something we think about quite a lot. It depends on what extreme size
means. But, certainly looking at, like say, the $5 million, $10 million, $20 million -- 5
million, 10 million, 20 million vehicle levels, you really have to analyze the sort of
macroeconomic, just like what is the tonnage of lithium that you need, of nickel, of
iron phosphate, of graphite separators, electrolytes. It looks like really you think of
like just macro tonnage.
And when we need to think about this for the world as a whole, because just -- we
want to -- what are limiting factors for accelerating the advent of a sustainable
energy future. And whatever those limiting factors are, Tesla will take action on those
limiting factors. So, right now, we think mining and refining lithium is -- appears to be
a limiting factor, and it certainly is responsible for quite a bit of cost growth in the
sales. It's I think the single biggest cost growth item right now, certainly on a
percentage basis. Although just for those who don't totally know this, the actual
content of lithium in a lithium-ion cell is maybe around 2% or 3% of the cell, so --
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
5 kgs a car.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. It's 5 kilograms, except it's not -- it's called a lithium-ion cell, but by far, like the
most expensive and heaviest item in the cell is the cathode. So, that's the nickel or
the iron phosphate. So, we're looking carefully at all of the raw materials and trying
to figure out how we can accelerate the total amount of raw materials needed to
transition the world to sustainability. And I think we've got -- we don't have enough
time on this call to really go through all those details, but we are thinking about
these things and we think we'll have some exciting announcements in the months to
come.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. One thing I want to call out is like, we're also committed to recycling at all of our
cell factories. We're recycling 50 tons a week right now in Reno and ramping to 150
tons with all of that reclaimed material going directly back into our cathode supply
chain. So, we're looking at the beginning and end of life needs here.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Lars Moravy
And that's true, like since in Reno we built the Gigafactory, we started getting out
batteries. But as we built newer factories or vehicles, for example Giga Texas here,
where we are today, we sent all of its non-yielded or scrap aluminum from the
stamping shop directly into the casting shop. We regrind any plastics that gets out.
And so we're really concerned about raw materials, not just like mining them and
consuming them, but when we get them in the door, using all 100% of them.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, Lars, that's a great point. So, we're restoring -- we're installing sort of furnaces
for aluminum, like sort for the Model Y that we've built here in Giga Texas has both a
front and a rear body casting. So, we're casting almost two-thirds of the body. Then
that -- it's high pressure die cast aluminum. And so, we can take both aluminum --
both scrap from the casting machine and the gating that comes out, and put that --
just really toss that back into the melting -- aluminum melting pot. And then, as Lars
was saying, also take any stampings and any other aluminum scrap and also throw
that in the melting pot. Matter of fact, we've also figured out that we can use wheels
from practically any car.
A - Unidentified Speaker
(inaudible) wheels.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, so we're going to be recycling the cast aluminum wheels from legacy gasoline
cars as well and throwing that in the melting pot for our aluminum cast body of
Model Y. And also we'll be moving to the sort of cast part rear body in all vehicles
over time. Well, actually, maybe not S/X, but 3/Y.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. At what rate do you expect Berlin and Austin to ramp relative to
Shanghai? Are you able to leverage learnings from Shanghai or are the processes
substantially different in the new factories?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Page 11 of 25
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
I think hopefully we should be able to ramp production faster than Shanghai
because we have learned a lot. And we've now gone through the -- we have
basically veteran teams that obviously in the 3/Y ramp -- Y ramp especially in
multiple locations. And we're obviously sharing what we've learnt. And so we don't
want to get complacent or entitled, but this should be a faster ramp because we
have learnt more, and we have done a lot to simplify the production process of
Model Y that should lead us to a faster ramp within Texas and Berlin. Yes.
A - Lars Moravy
We also had a structural casting, about 30% less robots, we expect to almost double
the capacity for body, for example, reducing the number of robots, but doubling our
capacity in a lot of areas.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, right. The body line for the structural pack is -- and if you got a structural pack
and front and rear castings, the body shop is -- body shop size drops by over 60%
relative to the standard way of making a car.
A - Unidentified Speaker
We got tax savings in general assembly and everything else, because we have the
structural battery, the floor is the battery. We put the seats on the battery and then
we put that in the cars. So there's actually 10% and 15% less (inaudible) engineering
because of the general assembly site.
So, really, like I think about this the way we think about cars. If you're waiting for the
best Tesla, you're going to be waiting forever. If you're waiting for the best factory,
you're also going to be waiting forever because every new factory is better than the
last one because we take all that learning and we try to (inaudible)
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. Next question is, at Cyber Rodeo Elon mentioned that a futuristic
driverless robotaxis vehicle is on the roadmap. When can we expect more details on
the product offering to be unveiled? Is this something that people can own or will
this be only offered by Tesla as a service?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So I think we want to hold up on -- we don't want to jump the gun on kind of exciting
product announcement too much. So, I think we'll aim to maybe do a product event
for robotaxi next year and get into more detail, but we are aiming for volume
production in 2024.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
All right. And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate
of 4680 cell production at Fremont and at Giga Texas? What do you expect run rates
of 4680 to be in Fremont and Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, Berlin is using the 2170 non-structural pack, so they're not constrained by 4680.
They will transition to 4680 hopefully later this year, but current production does not
require that. We also have, just as a risk mitigation, 2170 non-structural pack
capability here at Giga Texas as well. But if things go according to plan, we will be in
volume production with 4680 sometime perhaps towards the end of the third
quarter and certainly in the end of the fourth quarter. Is that accurate, Drew?
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. And the other thing I would add is like, with the China COVID shutdown and the
semiconductor bottlenecks we had through Q4 and hence a little bit in Q1, we have
sizable cell inventory at the moment and excess cells to support the 2022 volume
targets you described. So, that gives us the ability to be pretty deliberate in the 4680
ramp where we can maximize the learning step-by-step, take engineering down time
to upgrade key pieces of equipment and modify the structural pack design to
improve reliability, all while achieving what you just said, so.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. 4680 output is not a risk to achieving 1.5 million vehicles produced this year. But
it would become a risk next year if we do not solve volume production by early
2023, but we're highly confident of doing so.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Let's go to analyst questions now. The first question comes
from Dan Levy from CSFB. Please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Q - Dan Levy {BIO 17519730 <GO>}
Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. First, maybe you can just talk
through or address what some of the drivers of cost improvement were in the
quarter. Was it just further improvements within Shanghai, within Fremont, anything
around sort of ongoing kaizen that you've talked about in the past? Maybe you
could just talk through what you benefitted from in the first quarter?
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Sure. I mean at a high level, cars produced in Shanghai do carry a lower cost
structure than cars produced in Fremont. And so, as our mix of cars shift towards
Shanghai, the average cost is positively impacted by that. We're also seeing some
progress in manufacturing efficiencies in Fremont, particularly on the S and X side as
volume increases improves there. Expedite has been a huge story for the company.
In Q4, we had massive amounts of expedites. Q1 was still quite large, but we did
make progress bringing that down some.

A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, as Drew mentioned, credit goes to the Fremont manufacturing team and our
associates there because we're achieving record output at Fremont.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. The Fremont team is doing a tremendous job, (inaudible) from the back
quarters.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
It's hard to underweight, like you should -- expedite situation with the crazy logistics
that occurred with COVID. I mean --
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yes. And to Elon's point, the Fremont team and also the Shanghai team has been
extremely dynamic with the unpredictable nature of our part arrivals. And our supply
chain team, in particular production planning portion of supply team -- supply chain.
We often get very little notice when there's part shortages coming, and it's kind of a
scramble couple days before that part is supposed to arrive to figure out how to get
it here. And so, the amount of herculean effort that goes in to produce a quarter like
Q1 and even the quarters before that is absolutely immense. And certainly --
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's just like there is a saying in the military, it's like, amateurs talk about tactics,
professionals talk about logistics when it comes to war.
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yes. So there were some inherent cost improvements, as I mentioned, but there's
also offsets that we've talked about previously on raw materials, commodities.
Outbound logistics continues to remain a challenge despite a ton of efforts to
increase capacity there and bring those costs down.
Q - Dan Levy {BIO 17519730 <GO>}
Great.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yes. Thank you. Second question, one of the initial goals of Model 3 way back when
was to have an EV that was affordable for a wide portion of the market. And we know
prices are much higher now, just given the supply constraints, prices are higher for
all other automakers. We know that there is inflation that you're battling through and
some of that needs to be passed through to the price of vehicles. And you're going
to be supply constrained for the foreseeable future, so it's sort of a moot point. But
given the goal long-term of making EVs more widely available to the masses over
time, how do you look at the progression of prices over time?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We absolutely want to make EVs as affordable as possible. It's been very difficult with
the -- I mean, I think inflation is at like a 40 or 50 year high. And I think the official
numbers actually understate the true magnitude of inflation. So -- and that inflation
appears to be likely to continue for at least the remainder of this year, is what -- when
we're talking to suppliers, suppliers are under severe cost pressure. So, yeah. And in
some cases, we're seeing suppliers' request 20% to 30% cost increases for parts
from last year to the end of this year. So it's -- there's a lot of cost pressure there.
That's why we raised our prices because we know -- I mean when things are this
uncertain with respect to inflation, that you know it's high, then we got orders that go
out a year or more in some cases, then we have to anticipate those cost increases.
But I think especially with the robotaxis and autonomy, I think we will end up
providing consumers with by far the lowest cost per mile transport that they've ever
experienced. Yeah, I mean with robotaxi like maybe five to ten times cost per mile,
it's really quite substantial.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And therefore, accessible to everyone.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, looking at some of our projections, it would appear that a robotaxi ride
will cost less than a bus ticket, a subsidized bus ticket or a subsidized subway ticket.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question from Rod Lache from Wolfe
Research.
Q - Rod Lache {BIO 1528384 <GO>}
Hi, everybody. I'm trying to just parse out your comments about the inflation and
constrained supply in battery feedstocks, and the initiatives that you are working on
internally to secure these materials. It sounds like you're optimistic about Tesla's
ability to solve this for Tesla. Do you -- but do you see this as a constraint on EV
adoption more broadly?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Page 15 of 25
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yeah, absolutely. What's sort of keeping our cost down, at least in short term, is that
we have long-term contracts with suppliers, but those long-term contracts will
obviously run out, and then we'll start to see potentially significant cost increases.
But at a macro, sort of looking at the world as a whole and saying, okay, what does it
take for Earth to transition to sustainable energy faster? It's fundamentally -- the
fundamental limiting factor is the output of the cell -- basically cell output we have.
At what rate can lithium-ion cells increase the gigawatt hours per year? That is the
fundamental limiting factor. So, in order for -- and that will move as fast as the
slowest least lucky element of the whole supply chain.
Currently, we see that as being a challenge with lithium and it is not -- to be clear, it's
not that there's a shortage of lithium ore in the world, lithium is present almost
everywhere, it's a very common element. However, you still need to dig up ore, dig
up basically the spodumene [ph] or whatever the clay with the lithium, and then you
need to go through a whole series of refinement steps. And thus a lot of industrial
equipment is needed to refine lithium ore to lithium that can be used as lithium
hydroxide or lithium carbonate in the battery cell.
So, we think we're going to need to help the industry on this front. But the -- I mean
industry is growing fast. And it certainly encouraged entrepreneurs out there who
are looking for opportunities to get into the lithium business. Lithium margins right
now are practically software margins. I mean, if the -- it's something -- literally I think
if this -- I mean, Zach, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we're seeing cases where
the spot lithium price is 10 times higher than the cost of extraction. So it's not like
we're talking 90% margins here. Can more people please get into the lithium
business? Do you like minting money? Well, the lithium business is for you.
Q - Rod Lache {BIO 1528384 <GO>}
It's interesting. So, I guess we'll stay tuned to see what happens from that. My second
is, it's impressive to see just a modest increase in cost per vehicle, cost of goods sold
per vehicle given what we've seen in terms of commodities actually. And from here
you have a lot of savings, opportunities with 4680 cells and the cell manufacturing
changes, the anode chemistry structural packs, Giga castings. Are you suggesting
that even those may not be sufficient to offset the inflation that you're seeing and
that you're going to need additional pricing as well, in addition to those specific
initiatives that you've called out?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, we hope we don't need to increase the pricing further. The current pricing is
anticipating what we think is the probable growth in costs. And if those growth -- if
that growth in cost does not materialized, we actually may slightly reduce prices. So,
we do not currently anticipate making significant price increases. But obviously, we
don't control the macroeconomic environment. If governments keep printing vast
amounts of money and if there's not significant increases in lithium extraction and
refinement and other raw materials such that everyone's competing for a limited
amount of raw materials, then obviously that will drive prices to high levels. So it was
-- if you have a crystal ball that can tell us what the future is going to be like, we will
Page 16 of 25
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
adjust accordingly. But the current prices are what we -- the current prices are for a
vehicle delivered in the future like 6 to 12 months from now. So this is our best guess.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
But I think if you zoom out, right, like as you said, our mission is to accelerate the
transition to sustainable energy.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
So, we are working with our existing suppliers and others to figure out how to grow
all of these raw materials as quickly as possible, to not slow down the transition.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And whether that means we have to get directly involved in some cases or not
comes down to the counterparty and their willingness to expand the way we think
they should be able to expand. And that's similar to what we've done with
everything else, like we built a Gigafactory in Reno because it needed to be done.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And so like, we will do what needs to be done to not slow down the transition, and
affordability is a goal because if it's unaffordable, it's going to retard the growth of
what is inherently a good thing that we can't have that as an outcome.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Great. I'd like to ask you some questions about free cash flow. Do you -- so first
maybe in the long run, Elon, if you look at your performance and your growth model
material and your growth ambitions, I did the math real quick and I see you guys
sitting on $400 billion or maybe $500 billion of cash at the end of the decade. And I
was wondering if it's something you have given some thoughts about. (Multiple
Speakers)
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
If inflation keeps going crazy, $500 billion might be like $20 billion today. I don't
know. So, we will see what $500 billion buys you in a decade, but it might be a lot
less. So, I don't know if we'll -- that seems like a lot of cash. I don't know. We'll try to
do something useful with it, I mean Zach, salary hikes problem, that's for sure.
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
The way we've been -- I think we have to take this one step at a time. And so, we
have investments that are happening right now to get Austin and Berlin up and
running. And then, as Elon mentioned, installing capacity for robotaxi production.
And there's some decisions that, as Elon alluded to just, to share in the future about
what the economic model looks like for robotaxi. And so, the way Elon and I have
discussed this is --
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Let me just -- yeah, everyone just mute if you're not.
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yes. So our focus is to get to the point where robotaxis are on the road, Optimus is in
use, get the economic model for that dialed in. And then evaluate the size of cash
flows at that point and make decisions then as to what's next.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay. Pierre, do you have a follow-up question?

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Thank you. Two questions, I have. First is regarding the Cybertruck. I was wondering
like, in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with a traditional
pickup truck in terms of number of parts? The second question I have is on
Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks. Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory?
Or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin? Thank you.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I'm not sure if we've actually done a comparison of a Cybertruck parts versus regular
truck parts. I mean, Lars?
A - Lars Moravy
Yeah. I mean, if you want to go down, like depends what's your kind of part, we still
have cells (inaudible)
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
(Multiple speakers) count.
A - Lars Moravy
If we don't count that, the simplicity of our structure is significant versus a traditional
pickup truck or any other vehicle like, as we talked about the Giga castings, we save
hundreds of parts there.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I mean the entire rear half of the car is one cast.
A - Lars Moravy
And even so with the Cybertruck and the doors for example, we have an exoskeleton
design where the door is ready to take, and it takes a little bit of the side long-term
impacts. So we really have -- like we don't have the door reinforcements, we don't
have the (inaudible) beams. So to your point, haven't counted them because I don't
often look back at old technologies to decide how well I'm doing, I check that once
in a while. But in general, architecture is always moving to reduce complexity, reduce
parts, or reduce parts count. I would say ignoring the battery cells, we are probably
20% to 30% less.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
All right.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
All right. Okay. Thank you. Let's go to the next (Multiple Speakers)

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Do we expect to expand? Yes, we do expect to expand Giga Nevada. There is lot of
room for expansion there and we do expect to increase output from Nevada. But the
-- by far the biggest increase in output will be from Giga Texas.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler.
Hey, Alex. Can you hear us?
Q - Alexander Potter {BIO 16150582 <GO>}
Yes. Hi, Martin. Can you hear me?
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Yeah.
Q - Alexander Potter {BIO 16150582 <GO>}
Okay, great. So, first question I had was the extent to which other plants outside of
China are insulated from any further upstream supply bottlenecks that we may have
in China. Obviously, if this COVID lockdown thing gets out of hand, clearly that's
going to continue impacting Shanghai. But is there a point at point at which it could
actually also impact other facilities?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. If it were to continue, but there are some parts that are sourced from China that
apply worldwide. And that would be -- that would impact production elsewhere. But
all indications are that we are -- Shanghai is back in production at fairly high levels
already and so are our suppliers. So we don't think this is going to be a big deal.
Q - Alexander Potter {BIO 16150582 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks. And second question. Obviously, the higher profitability you guys
have been able to experience over the last couple quarters, a lot of that is reflecting
sort of, quote-unquote, real improvements. Another part of it is because we're no
longer paying you, Elon, as much as we were. So, I'm wondering, the extent to which
you and the Board are in the process of contemplating another one of these long-
term compensation packages, which in the past have seemed to work quite well?
Thanks.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
There are no discussions, currently underway for incremental compensation for me.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question comes from Colin Langham from Wells Fargo.
Q - Colin Langham
Page 20 of 25
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Great. Do you guys hear me?
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Yeah.
Q - Colin Langham
Perfect. Just a follow-up, sorry, to keep going on the raw material issue on the battery
side, but obviously it seems pretty important. How quickly can raw material supply
be built? Because my understanding is, it takes many years to build that out. So, are
we just sort of facing -- When do you think we will see a lithium shortage or a nickel
shortage? And is there even enough time to build that sort of mining capacity in
place? And then related, how quickly can you switch to like LFP for the nickel issue?
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, I'll take the LFP question. Like, it says so in our letter that like half of our
products were LFP last quarter, which shows how quickly we were able to respond to
-- well, honestly, it wasn't because of a raw material shortage, but just because it
seemed like the right thing to do, we could change our cathode chemistry. And
there's more to be done on the cathode side and we are actively pursuing it to give
us substitution flexibility in response to market conditions between the other
cathodes that are out there that can be competitive in our vehicles, for which there
are many options.
So we -- I guess, what I would say is, specifically on the cathode side, like flexibility is
the way we're going to achieve this and not all of the materials that go into cathodes
are actually, first of all, hard to secure like they're mining or refining. And second of
all, in many cases are like very plentiful already, like huge scale. And if all of the
batteries in the world use those cathodes, it's less than a 1% increase in total annual
output. So that's the cathode side.
I think, Elon already spent a lot of time talking about lithium. It really depends on the
resource, some resources like just getting rocks out of the ground, expanding the
amount of rocks you're getting out of the ground is, maybe a little bit of paperwork
and some additional sort of blasting and trucking operations. The refining is maybe
where there's -- it's a little bit more chunky to bring it online. But also the refining
doesn't -- it's not like an oil refinery, it's a much smaller operation to refine lithium
out of spodumene or liquid, like a brine or salt pond evaporation. So, you're talking
about a time scale of one to two years.
And it's not like we haven't been talking to all of the lithium suppliers out there for
many years. They have a lot of projects already in the pipeline to come online this
year and next. Some of what's going on in the lithium market this year doesn't
actually have truth to bear to the like fundamentals of supply and demand, which is
also a little frustrating. But, yeah, if we look past this year and next year, into 2030
when we need 15 terawatt to 20 terawatt hours of this stuff to get on the growth
trajectory -- stay on the growth trajectory we're on, we need everybody to do more
in the lithium space than they currently are.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
I don't know if that answers the question.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Yeah. Fantastic. Thank you very much. So, let's go to the last question from Mark
Delaney Goldman Sachs.
Q - Mark Delaney {BIO 20093495 <GO>}
Yes. Good afternoon. And thank you very much for taking the question. I was hoping
you could comment on your latest thoughts about potentially opening up the
charging network in the U.S. to non-Tesla owners. It's certainly really important to
have a good experience for Tesla owners in terms of wait times at charging stalls. But
if Tesla is able to have enough capacity, it could be a really good way to bring other
vehicle owners into the Tesla network, perhaps hope Tesla to sustain its network
benefits and maybe make more people likely to buy Tesla vehicles in the future.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. As Elon has said and as we've publicly committed, yeah, we do plan to provide
third-party vehicle access all over the world, not just in Europe where our original
pilot was. And we are working on solutions in North America, which is a little bit
more problematic with our connector being different than others. But we are moving
in that direction, I feel like that.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, I think that's -- there's like nothing more to be said on that, but we're yes, we
want to do the right things with respect to the whole system.
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
And we're going faster on adding chargers.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Absolutely.
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
With the growth of the cars that we're producing and then anticipating what you
were just discussing, overall charger capacity is really important. And so the pace of
our investments in supercharging has accelerated.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Absolutely.
Q - Mark Delaney {BIO 20093495 <GO>}
Okay. That's helpful. And for my second question, could you share any more details
on Tesla Insurance in particular as you're rolling it out in more states? Are there any
Page 22 of 25
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-04-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
metrics you can share and what take rates have been like? And how do profitability
margins on the insurance offering compare to the corporate average? Thank you.
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
So we just launched Tesla Insurance for real-time insurance in Virginia, Colorado and
Oregon earlier this week. Maybe one step that I'll share is that Texas is our longest
standing real term insurance market. But based upon the information that we have,
Tesla is the second largest insurer of Teslas in the state of Texas. And possibly by the
end of this quarter, maybe early next quarter we'll be the largest insurer of Teslas.
And so the customer reception to this has been quite positive.
And I was reading social media on Monday after we launched in the three new
states, a lot of folks who are reporting their stories of saving quite substantial
amounts of money relative to their previous insurance. And so, we're quite
encouraged by that and we're working as quickly as we can to get to 80% of
customers having access to a Tesla Insurance product by the end of this year, in the
United States. At which point we'll pivot our attention to expansion outside of the
U.S.
The other thing I'll say on insurance is with these three new states, the model is
different, because we are now the underwriter and we are also not holding the risk.
And so, with those states, we are a fully vertically integrated provider of insurance
from systems and financials. With respect to the financials of the program, it's still
very early. And so, as the program gets more scaled, happy to share more
information on that.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
And one side note is that we are seeing that having real-time feedback for driving
habits is actually resulting in Tesla owners driving the cars in a safer way. So, because
they can see the -- they get real time feedback on, okay, this is affecting my insurance
rate or it isn't. And so when people see -- could see a real time score and realize, oh,
if I make the following changes in my driving habits, then I pay less in insurance.
Then they have a very -- like a real time feedback loop for driving -- for safer driving,
and incentive to do so. So it is -- actually what we're seeing is it is causing people to
drive their cars in a safer manner, which is also net good.
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
It's safer on average what we see in the data to Elon's point, and premiums are
lower. We see that in the take rate data. We have extremely high retention for
customers who experience the product. And I think, I've talked about this in the past,
but this has become a real passion program for us.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}

For these benefits, it's bigger than just the economics. We're trying to do a good
thing here for our customers, save people money and make the roads a little bit
safer.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I think it improves just overall macroeconomic efficiency. It's also a feedback
loop for Tesla because we see if there is a crash, both large or small, we sort of see
exactly what that caused. And then we think about how can we change the design of
the car or the software in order to minimize the probability of that accident. Most
accidents are minor, but how do you -- how those accidents occur less frequently,
and how do we make the repair associated with that accident super-fast? Like,
aspirationally, it would be like a same-day repair for a collision, which is just night
and day difference compared to sometimes having to wait for a month while
insurance claims are settled and figured out, because Tesla is also doing collision
repair.
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Again, the feedback loop is instant.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Right. So, I mean, we do claims management in-house. And so, we receive the
notification that there's an accident, we work to prepare the estimate. And we can,
with the support of our customers, use our collision centers to do the repair.

Yes.

And so it's full end-to-end visibility. And all of that, to Elon's point, we can then
identify areas of cost inefficiency, feed those back to our engineering teams or
elsewhere, software teams, actually improve the product. This lowers the cost of
insurance, improves reliability of the product. So, it's a full circle.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. And basically, the customer experience is just vastly better because if there's an
accident, there's no argument, we'll repair it immediately. And this is as compared to
arguing with an insurance company and then a claims adjuster and then a collision
repair center. And this can be a nightmare basically. So we're trying to turn a
nightmare into a dream with Tesla Insurance.
