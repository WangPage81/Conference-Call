Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Tesla's second quarter
2021 Q&A webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number
of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in
the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking
statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of
today. Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one
question and one follow-up. Please press star one now if you would like to join the

question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
Elon?
Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. So, to recap, Q2 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. We achieved record
production, deliveries, and surpassed over $1 billion in GAAP net income for the first
time in Tesla history. I'd really like to congratulate everyone at Tesla for amazing job.
This is really an incredible milestone.
It also seems that public sentiment towards EVs is at an inflection point. And at this
point, I think almost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward.
Regarding supply chain, while we're making cars at full speed, the global chip
shortage situation remains quite serious. For the rest of this year, our growth rate will
be determined by the slowest part in a our supply chain, which is a -- there's been a
wide range of chips that are, at various times, the slowest part in the supply chain.
I mean, it's worth noting that if we had everything else, if we had vast numbers of
vehicles and cells, we would not be able to make them -- everything except the
chips, we wouldn't be able to make them. The chip supply is fundamentally the
governing factor on our output. It is difficult for us to say how long this will last,
because we don't have -- this is out of our control, essentially. It does seem like it's
getting better, but it's hard to predict.
So, in fact, even achieving the output that we did achieve was only due to an
immense effort from people within Tesla. We were able to substitute alternative chips
and then write the firmware in a matter of weeks. It's not just a matter of swapping
out a chip; you also have to rewrite the software. So, it was an incredibly intense
effort of finding new chips, writing new firmware, integrating it to vehicle and testing
in order to maintain production.
And I'd also like to thank our suppliers, who work with us. And there have been
many calls, midnight, 1:00 a.m., just with suppliers in resolving a lot of the shortages.
So, thanks very much to our suppliers.
Let's see. In terms of FSD subscription, we were able to launch full self-driving
subscription last month. And we expect it to build slowly and then gather a lot of
momentum over time. Obviously, we need to have the full self-driving build widely
available for it really to take off at high rates, and we're making a lot of progress
there. So, yes, I think FSD subscription will be a significant factor probably next year.
Regards to Giga Texas and Giga Berlin, we're actually doing this earnings call from
Giga Texas. So, we're in the factory right now doing this earnings call -- this earnings
call. And the team has made incredible progress here. You can see the pictures
online, and see that there was basically nothing a year ago. And this large, mostly
complete, large factory, a year later. So, really great work by the Giga Texas team.
Page 2 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
And then also a great work in Berlin-Brandenburg with the team there. So, we expect
to be producing the new design of the Model Y in both factories in limited
production later this year
It's always like it's not -- it's hard to sort of explain to people, who have not been
through the agony of a manufacturing ramp. Like why can't you just turn it on and
make 5,000 a week. This is -- it is so hard to do manufacturing, it is so hard to do
production. The best approximation, there are 10,000 unique parts and processes
that have to work. And the greater growth of production goes as fast as the least
lucky and dumbest of those 10,000 things. And a bunch of them are not even in our
control, so it's insanely difficult.
I'm fond of saying that prototypes are easy and production is hard. And arguably, the
really remarkable thing that Tesla has done is not to make an electric car or to be a
car startup, because there have been hundreds of car startups in the United States
and outside the United States, so the thing that's remarkable is that Tesla didn't go
bankrupt in reaching volume production. That's the amazing part, because everyone
else did. Because they all thought the prototype or the idea was the hard part, and it
is not; it is trivial by comparison with actual production.
So, it's always worth noting that of all the American car companies, there are only
two that have not gone bankrupt, and that is Ford and Tesla. So, the seeds of defeat
are sown on the day of victory. And we must be careful that we do not do that.
They're often -- if you look at history, so often that the seeds of defeat are sown on
the day of victory. We will endeavor not to make that the case at Tesla.
So, let's see. The model lines in Texas, and made in Texas and Berlin, will look very
much like the Model Ys we currently make, but there are substantial improvements in
the difficulty of manufacturing. So, for example, the Model Y made here and in Berlin
will have a cast front body and a cast rear body. Whereas the one in California has a
cast rear body, but not a cast front body. We're also aiming to do a structural pack
with 4680s cells, which is a mass reduction and a cost reduction. But we're not
counting on that as the only way to make things work.
We have some backup plan with a non-structural pack and 2170s essentially. So, at
scale production, we obviously want to be using 4680s and a structural pack. From a
physics standpoint, this is the best architecture; and from an economic standpoint, it
is the lowest cost way to go, so the lightest, lowest cost.
But there's a lot of new technology there, so it is difficult to predict with precision
when does it work and when you reach scale production. An Drew is going to talk a
bit more about the 4680 production. We are making great progress on 4680 cells,
but there are -- there is a tremendous amount of innovation that we're packing into
that 4680 cell. And so it's not simply a minor improvement on state-of-the-art. There
are, and we went through this on the battery cell day, really dozens of -- half a dozen
major improvements and dozens of small improvements. So, I think it will be great.
But it's difficult to say when the last of the technical challenges will be solved.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
So, in conclusion, our team continues to make huge efforts to make our factories run
at full speed, which is very difficult. We have had some factory shutdowns due to part
shortages. And we hope those will be relieved in the coming weeks and months.
And we're making great progress on full self-driving. Solid progress is not easy to
see, because this has to go to foundational software level. And so, then it's updating
sort of a two steps forward, one step back situation. But over time, should do two
steps forward, one step back, and keep going, you do move forward. So, I'm highly
confident that the cars will be capable of full self-driving. If they have a full self-
driving computer and the cameras, I'm confident that they will be able to drive
themselves with the safety levels substantially greater than that of the average
person.
Once again, thanks to all of our employees, who are making this a breakthrough year
for Tesla and an incredible quarter. Thanks, guys.
Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much, and we have some follow-up remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn.
Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, Martin; and thanks, Elon. Just to reiterate, Q2 was a great quarter for the
Tesla team with strong improvements across the business. In particular, auto gross
profit and margin excluding credits increased substantially. This was primarily driven
by better cost optimization across our factories, good execution against our cost
reduction plans, as well as increases in production and delivery volumes. There was
some benefit from pricing action, mostly in North America. However, it was small in
the context of the other contributors.
Note that the Model S and X program was at a slight loss for the quarter due to the
relatively low volume. In supply chain challenges including expedites continued to
provide cost headwinds. Additionally, it's encouraging to see the progress made on
profitability within our energy and services and other businesses. While there's some
benefit to looking at our progress quarter-over-quarter, I find it more helpful to look
at progress over a slightly long-term horizon.
Over the last two years, our vehicle delivery volumes have more than doubled. This
volume increase was made possible by a steady decrease in ASPs of more than 10%,
driven by a roadmap to increase affordability and shifting mix towards our more
affordable vehicles. Yet over that same period of time, our auto gross margin
excluding credits has increased nearly 10 percentage points to our highest yet since
the introduction of Model 3. This is only possible, because our average cost per
vehicle has reduced by more than the reduction in average price. This is a
remarkable achievement in the context of the volume growth and ASP reduction as
mentioned, and a testament to the hard work by the Tesla team.
Additionally, OpEx as a percentage of revenue has declined and in particular SG&A,
representing the work we've done to become more efficient as we scale the
Page 4 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Company while still making the required R&D investments to support our future. As
a result, our GAAP operating margins have risen from negative to double-digit, in
line with what we have guided. By managing our overhead costs and driving higher
volumes, our P&L is benefiting from the marginal profitability of each incremental
unit; or said differently, we are recognizing the benefits of scale and improved fixed
cost absorption.
With strong operating cash flows and cash balance, we are putting that cash to use.
CapEx continues to tick up, primarily driven by capacity investments in Austin, Berlin,
and Shanghai. Additionally, each quarter, we are using our cash to retire legacy debt,
which was taken on at a time when interest rates and company risk were much
higher than in today's environment.
As I mentioned before, our 2021 volumes will skew towards the second half of the
year as we push for continued sequential increases in volume. Despite the great
work so far managing the instability of the supply chain, these challenges remain
and are unfortunately increasing in pain with the higher volume. As we work to the
uncertainty, we want to ensure we do our best to manage customer wait time as well
as the impact these interruptions have on our employees and costs. And as Elon
mentioned, volume growth will be determined by parts availability as we have the
factory capacity ready and are in a strong demand position. I'm excited to see the
progress made by the Tesla team as we continue building the business and
strengthening our financials. Thank you very much.
Questions And Answers

(Question And Answer)
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Great. Thank you very much, Zach. And now let's go through the retail investor
questions on say.com. The first question from Robert M. Is, Tesla's website still says
Cybertruck production is expected to begin in late 2021. Can Tesla share more
details on the current status of the Cybertruck and confirm if production is still
(Technical Difficulty)
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay.

Lars, do you want to --
A - Lars Moravy
Page 5 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Sorry, we cut out there for a second. Yeah, the Cybertruck is currently in its alpha
stages. We finished the basic engineering architecture of the vehicle. With the
Cybertruck, we're redefining how the vehicle is being made. As Elon said, it carries
much of the structural pack and large casting designs of the Model Y being built in
Berlin and Austin. Obviously, those take priority over the Cybertruck, but we are
moving into the beta phases of Cybertruck later this year and will be looking to ramp
that in production in Giga Texas after Model Y is up and going.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, it's just worth reemphasizing that the extraordinary difficulty of ramping
production of large manufactured items. With risk of being repetitive, it is essentially
easy to make prototypes or sort of handbook small volume production. But anything
produced at a high-volume, which is really what's relevant here is it's going to move
as fast as the slowest of the say rough order magnitude 10,000 unique parts and
processes. And so, you can have 9,999, but just one is missing -- I mean we were
missing, for example, like -- a big struggle this quarter, was the module that controls
the airbags and the seatbelts. And obviously you cannot ship a car without those.
And that -- that's -- that limited our production severely worldwide, in Shanghai and
at Fremont. So, it's like it wouldn't have mattered if we had 17 different car models,
because we -- they won't need the airbag module, so it's just irrelevant.
So, the -- in order for Cybertruck and Semi to scale to volume that's meaningful for
customer deliveries, we've got to solve the chip shortage working with our suppliers.
The dealers kind of say, why don't you just built a chip fab. Okay, well -- okay, that
would take us even moving like lightning 12 to 18 months. So, it's not like -- you can
just whip up a chip fab; it's just like, yeah, let's make a chip fab. So, some of these
things are -- yeah, anyway, it is quite a trial dealing with all of the constraints of
scaling a large manufactured object.
I think it may be the case that Tesla is scaling -- I think we might be the fastest in
history ever for scaling a large manufactured object. I think maybe the Model T
would have been comparable back in the day, the Ford Model T; probably Internet
knows the answer. But I think we may be just scaling large manufactured objects at
the fastest rate in history or I'd like to know who did it faster so we can learn from
them. So, it's worth just noting that, you know, in the grand scheme of things, it's not
bad.
So, yeah; so, the Cybertruck and Semi, actually both are heavy users of cell capacity.
So, we got to make sure we have the cell capacity for those two vehicles or it's kind
of pointless. We can make a small number of vehicles. But the effective cost if you
make a small number of vehicles is insane, like this would only cost $1 million a piece
or more. And there's a reason why you think the volume production, which is to get
the economies of scale that'll get the cost down. So, we are looking at a pretty
massive increase in cell availability next year, but it's not like in January 1, it's -- it
comes through -- it ramps up through the course of next year. But even without Tesla
--

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
(Technical Difficulty)
Hello? Okay. Even without Tesla cell production, maybe our suppliers will be able to
deliver about twice as much cell output in next year as this year.
Drew, do you want to talk more about that?
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. Given concerns over cell bottleneck and growth, our target is to grow cell
supply ahead of the 50% year-on-year growth targets of the vehicle business and
also enable increased energy storage deployments.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
So, yeah, cell suppliers are tracking to double their production in 2022.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, it's worth noting like if you have a target of certain number, that doesn't mean it
happens like as sure as night follows day, it hits the target. So, if there is some
calamity in the world that interrupts the supply chain, then it will be less. But the
contracts that we have with cell suppliers call for roughly a doubling of cell supply to
Tesla in 2022. And we have to juggle these exponential -- this whole bunch of
exponential graph sort of overlay on top of each other and small changes and where
you are on the X axis of time can quite substantially change the area under the
probe. So, what we're thinking of doing is like it's depending on -- especially
overshooting on cell supply for vehicles. And then as we have to say, excess cell
supply in one month or another, then routing that cell output to the Megapack and
Powerwall; or by the same token, if we're prioritizing vehicle production, if there's a
shortage of cell for some reasons, then we will throttle down Megapack and
Powerwall production. So, it could be -- something's got to give basically.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Or if there's a disruption in the vehicle production --
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
-- in the outlet for cell --
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Page 7 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yes, exactly. There's a tremendous amount of inertia in the supply chain. So if we say
it to a supplier, we want you to double cell output, well, even doing that in a year is
very difficult and then that system has a tremendous amount of momentum, it is like
a plateau of supertankers; it's insane.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Speaking of which from a raw material perspective, we also have long-term contracts
to secure our supply chain to also enable its growth. So, we're not just looking at the
suppliers, but upstream from there.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, exactly.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Which is more flexible.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, exactly. As mentioned, things will move as fast as the slowest part of the entire
supply chain, which goes all the way back to raw materials, lithium, and nickel and
that kind of thing. And there is sometimes misperception that Tesla uses a lot of
cobalt, but we actually don't. Apple uses, I think, almost 100% cobalt in their
batteries and cell phones and laptops, but Tesla uses no cobalt in the iron phosphate
patch and almost none in the nickel-based chemistries.
So, on a weighted average basis, we might use 2% cobalt compared to say Apple's
100% cobalt. Anyway, so it's just -- it's really just not a factor, we expect basically to
have zero cobalt in the future. So, you know, I do say with -- I think probably there is a
long-term shift more in the direction of iron-based lithium-ion cells rather over nickel.
As the energy density of sort of iron ore -- the iron phosphate might as well support
iron phosphate -- taken for granted, but iron-based cells, lithium-ion cells and nickel-
based lithium-ion cells, I think probably we'll see a shift. My guess is probably two-
thirds iron, one-third nickel or something on that order.
And this was actually good, because there's plenty of iron in the world. There's an
insane amount of iron, but nickel is -- there is much less nickel and there's way less
cobalt. So, it is good for relieving the long-term scaling to move to iron-based cells
mostly. And I think long-term -- possibly all -- there's a good chance that all
stationary storage that is Powerwall and Megapack move to iron. It seems most likely
the case since you do not need to transport it and there's less of volume that's
constraint for stationary storage. So, then nickel would be for really for long-range
road transport, ships, and aircraft that kind of thing.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. Let's go to the second question from retail, which is Elon has said that
Tesla will be opening up the Supercharger network to other EVs later this year. Can
Page 8 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
you share some more details on how this will be structured? Will this be select
brands or will they contribute to the growth of this network?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. We're currently thinking it's a real simple thing, where you just download the
Tesla app and you go to a Supercharger, and you just indicate which store you are in.
So, you plug in your car even if it's not Tesla, and then you just access the app and
say, turn on the store that I'm in for how much electricity. And this should basically
work with I think almost any manufacturers' cars.
There will be a time constraint. So, if the charge rate is super slow, then somebody
will be charged more, because the biggest constraint at the Superchargers is time,
how occupied is the store. And we'll also be smarter with how we charge for
electricity at the Supercharger. So, rush hour of charging will be more expensive
than -- car is charging, because there are times when the Superchargers were empty
and times when they're jam-packed, and so it makes sense to have some time-based
discrimination.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes, we've been doing that and it's been working.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And people will respond and it helps with utilization and things like that.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, exactly. So, yes, I think we're -- in Europe and China and most part of the world,
it's the same connector for everyone. So, this is a fairly easy thing to do, developed
our own connector, which in my opinion is actually develop supercharging. Tesla was
the only one, who had a high powered charging and it was standard. So, we
developed our own connector, which in my opinion it's actually the best connector.
It's small and light, looks good. So, an adapter is needed to work for EVs in North
America, but people could buy this adapter, and we anticipate having it available at
the superchargers as well if people don't of steal them or something.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
We have a good solution to that.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay. So, that's constraint on North American thing.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Page 9 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yeah.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
That's basically a vestige of history. But I think we do emphasize that it is -- our goal
is to support the advent of sustainable energy. It is not to create a walled garden and
use that to bludgeon our competitors, which is sometimes used by some companies.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
I think, it's also important to comment that increasing the utilization of the network
actually reduces our costs, which allows us to lower charging prices for our
customers, makes the network more profitable, allows us to grow the network faster,
so it's a good thing there. And no matter what, we're going to continue to
aggressively expand the network capacity, increasing charging speed, improving the
trip planning tools to protect against site congestion using dynamic pricing as Elon
mentioned.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And just continue to focus on minimum wait time for all customers.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. Obviously, in order for this to be -- for the Superchargers be useful to other car
companies' cars, we need to grow the network faster than we're growing vehicle
output --
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
-- which is not easy. We're growing vehicle output data at a -- at hell of a rate. So,
Superchargers need to grow faster than vehicle output. So, this is a lot of work for
the Supercharger team, but it is only useful in the grand scheme of things. It's only
useful to the public if we're able to grow faster than Tesla vehicle output.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So, that is our goal.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Page 10 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Thank you very much. And the third question is, Elon said 4680 cells aren't reliable
enough for vehicles. Is this referring to cycle life degradation or something else?
Please update us on the progress of 4680s? And what still needs to be done to
make them reliable enough for vehicles?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, really, this is not -- we'll definitely make the 4680 reliable enough for
vehicles, and I think are at the point, where in limited volume it is reliable enough for
vehicles.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The -- again, going back to like limited production is easy, prototype production is
easy, but high-volume production is hard. There are a number of challenges in
transitioning from sort of small-scale production to large volume production. And
not to get too much into the leads of things, but right now, we have a challenge to
grow up with basically the -- what's called calendaring or basically squashing the
cathode material to a particular height. So, it just goes through these rollers and gets
squashed like pizza dough basically, but very hard pizza dough. And it's causing --
it's denting the calendar rolls. This is not something that happened when the
calendar rolls were smaller, but it's happening when the calendar rolls are bigger.
So, it's just like -- we're like, okay, we weren't expecting that.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. It's not -- it's not a like science problem, it's an engineering problem. It's not a
question of if, it's a question of when.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And the team is 100% focused on resolving these limiting processes as quickly as
possible.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Exactly.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. And on the reliability side, as Elon mentioned, we have successfully validated
performance and the lifetime durability of the 4680 cells produced in Kato. And
we're continuing ongoing verification of that reliability. We're actually accruing over 1
million equivalent miles on our cells that we produce every month. In our testing
Page 11 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
activities, the focus on that is very clear. We want high-quality cells for all of our
customers. And yeah, we're just focused on the unlucky limiting steps in the facility.
And with the engineers focused on those few steps remaining, we're going to break
through as fast as possible.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Meantime, we're -- we have a massive amount of equipment on order and arriving
for the high-volume cell production in Austin and Berlin. And -- but obviously, given
what we've learned with the pilot plant, which is in Fremont, which is really quite a
big plant by most standards. We will have to modify a bunch of that equipment, so it
won't be able to start immediately. But it seems like, correct me if I'm wrong, but we
think, most likely, we will hit an annualized rate of a 100 gigawatt hours a year
sometime next year.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
We'll have all the equipment installed --
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
-- to accomplish a 100 gigawatt hours and it's possible.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
That by the end of the year, we will be at an annualized rate of 100 gigawatt hours by
the end of the year.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, My guess is more likely than not, above 50% of reaching 100 gigawatt
hours a year by the end of next year on the annualized rate, something like that.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It could shift by a little bit, so --
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah, and --

A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
-- but it's like nothing as Drew mentioned, nothing fundamental.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
No.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Just a lot of work.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. And even to the large roller question, Elon, right, like on the anode side, the
large rollers work great, no concerns. And so, we're just learning as we go. And the
nice thing about having that facility on a fast-track like we had it, and we talked about
it at battery day, was really de-risking the big factories here --
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
-- we've done and we've learned a lot. And with each successive iteration, the ramp
up and the equipment installation will be faster and more stiff.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
All right. Thank you very much. And the last question from retail is from Emmett. Can
Elon do an interview with one of our YouTube channels once or twice a year? I would
nominate David Lee on Investing or Rob Maurer's Tesla Daily channels as first
possible candidates.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. I guess, yeah, I'll do your interview. I mean spare my head, like if I'm doing
interviews and I can't do actual other work. So, it's not -- there's only so much time in
the day. So, but right, yeah, I'll do it once. No, I wouldn't do it annually, but I'll do it
once. I think also like this is the -- wouldn't say the last time I'll do earnings call, but
this is the -- I will no longer be default doing earnings calls. So, obviously, I'll do the
annual shareholder meeting, but I think going forward I will most likely not be on
earnings calls, unless there's something really important that I need to say.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you. Now let's go to institutional questions. The first one and we
covered a lot of this already. Can you please update us on timelines for the start of
production of Berlin and Austin, Model Y Cybertruck and the Semi? Do you expect
the ramp of Cybertruck to be as difficult as it is a new process?
Page 13 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think Cybertruck ramp will be difficult, because it's such a new architecture. I mean
it's going to be a great product. This might, I think it will be our best product ever,
but it does a lot of fundamentally new design ideas in Cybertruck. Nobody's ever
really made a car like this before -- a vehicle like this before. So, there will probably
be challenges, because there's so much unexplored territory. Yeah.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. I think question 2 and question 3, we can skip, given we have already
addressed it. I'll go to question 4. In five years' time, how much faster or better could
you be at manufacturing capacity expansion, using current pace and what are the
biggest issues you need to solve to get to that rate?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, like I said, I think we might be the fastest growing company in history for any
large manufactured item. So those who have not actually been involved in
manufacturing around have just no idea how painful and difficult it is. It's like there's
-- you got to eat a lot of glass -- and -- for automating production ramp is hard.
A - Lars Moravy
Yeah. I mean I think, if you look at the expansion we've done in Shanghai, that factory
was built in less than a year and ramped in five to six months to full volume.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It took longer than that. Took longer than that, about a year.
A - Lars Moravy
And when you consider cut-and-paste, we've repeated that in Fremont and
whatever. But now with Berlin and Austin, we have new factories and new designs.
And so there's always challenges as you said, Elon, with new designs and ramping
that. But I think having teams in three locations or three continents will definitely
expand our ability and our capacity to grow more lines, rather than just having the
one factory in Fremont that we had year and half ago.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. So, I mean for Shanghai, it's simply incredible the team built the factory in 11
months, but it took longer than -- it's longer than building the factory. It took longer
than that to actually reach volume production -- high volume production. So, took
about a year. So when you put a factory in a new geography, in order for that factory
to be efficient, you have to localize the supply chain. So, there's no such thing as cut
and paste. It does not exist.
And obviously, it would be insane to do vehicle production in Europe and send vast
numbers of parts from North America. That would be -- that would make producing
Page 14 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
in Europe, for example, just crazy. You've got to localize the supply chains, have
efficiency, and then you're moving as fast as your least lucky, least goods supplier.
Yeah, some of these supply chains, when you go like three or four layers deep. Its
frankly, I feel at times that we are inheriting force majeure on Earth. So if anything
goes wrong anywhere on Earth, something happens to mess up the supply chain.
So, yeah.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. I think the human capital growth of having factory here in Berlin, Shanghai and
Fremont does a lot of stuff, maybe not exponentially grow, but hopefully --
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We are exponentially growing.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. Hopefully, maintain that exponential growth.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. So it also -- it takes a while to hire old people and train old people to operate
the factory. The factory is like giant cybernetic collective. And you can't just hire
10,000 people and have them -- have work instantly. It's not possible.
I really encourage more people to get involved in manufacturing. I think especially in
the U.S., like this is just not in an area where all that many smart people have gone
into. I think U.S. has an over-allocation of talent in finance and law. It's both a criticism
and a compliment. I'm not saying we shouldn't have people in finance and law, I'm
just saying this might be -- maybe we have too many smart people in those arenas
really. Maybe? So--
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Manufacturing is fun.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, manufacturing is great. It's a very interesting problem to solve, and obviously
you can't have stuff unless someone makes it. That's how you get stuff. Yeah.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you very much. And let's go to the last investor question. Does Tesla
plan to offer more services beyond FSD or high-speed connectivity as part of its
subscription bundle going forward? What areas in particular present an opportunity?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. We don't have a lot of ideas on this to be frank. Really, full self-driving is the
main thing. Things are obviously headed towards fully autonomous electric vehicle
Page 15 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
future. And I think Tesla is well-positioned and frankly is the leader objectively in
both of those arenas, electrification and autonomy.
So as always, it's always temping to strike client analogies with other companies,
whatever. But really the value of fully electric autonomous fleet is extremely gigantic,
boggles the mind really. So that will be one of the most valuable things that is ever
done in the history of civilization.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. And now let's go back to analyst Q&A please.
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions.) Our first question comes from Colin Rusch with
Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Thanks so much guys. Can you speak to the attached rates for FSD so far? And
where you're targeting in terms of the subscription numbers?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. It's not worth commenting on right now, it's not meaningful. We really need
both full self-driving, at least, the beta to be widely available, so anyone who wants it
can get it. Otherwise, it'll be pointless to read anything into where things are right
now. And so -- yeah.
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Okay. And then just the follow up there is about the cadence of the regulatory
environment, keeping up with the technology. Are you seeing meaningful evolution
in terms of the regulators really understanding the technology and beginning to set
some standards here sometime in near term?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
At least in the U.S., we don't see regulation as the fundamental limiter. We've
obviously got to make it work and then demonstrate that the reliability is significantly
in excess of the average human driver, for it to be allowed -- for you to be able to
use it without paying attention to the road. But I think we have a massive fleet. So it
will be, I think, straightforward to make the arguments on statistical grounds, just
based on the number of interventions, especially in events that would result in a
crash.
At scale, it will have billions of miles of travel to be able to show that it is the safety of
the car with autopilot on is 100% or 200% or more safer than the average human
driver. At that point, I think it would be unconscionable to not to allow autopilot,
because the car just becomes way less safe. It would be sort of like shake the
elevator analogy. Back in the day, we used to have elevator operators with like a big
Page 16 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
switch that -- and they operate the elevator and move between floors. But they get
tired or maybe drunk or something or distracted and every now and again,
somebody would be kind of sheared in half between floors. That's kind of the
situation we have with cars.
Autonomy will become so safe that it will be unsafe to manually operate the car
relatively speaking. And today obviously we just get an elevator, we press the button
for which floor we want, and it just takes us there safely.
And it would be quite alarming if those elevators were operated by a person with a
giant switch. That's how it would be with cars.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. Let's go to the next question please.
Operator
Next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Q - Rod Lache {BIO 1528384 <GO>}
Hi, everybody. Your cost of goods sold per vehicle is already down to the mid
$37,000 range in the quarter. It's down $5,000 year-over-year despite some of the
inefficiencies that you talked about. And I know that a lot is going to change from
here, just given how mix is going to evolve. But if you're successful on the structural
pack and front and rear castings in the launch of the 4680 cell, can you just maybe
give us a sense of what a successful outcome would look like, maybe a year from
now? Obviously, a lot has to go right, but just any kind of broad framework for us to
think about.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, it's really difficult for us -- to make specific predictions it's very difficult. I think we
felt confident of say at least a few percent growth year-over-year next year, and
maybe it's a 100%. But that's -- we need a lot of crystal balls to figure out exactly
what it's going to be. And it is literally impossible to make a specific prediction. But
at least 50, maybe 100, something like that.
Q - Rod Lache {BIO 1528384 <GO>}
Okay, and maybe just separately from this. Can you just clarify what the status is of
some of the advances in battery manufacturing, things like dry cathode mixing that
you talked about on battery day. What's the timeline? How are those evolving?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah (multiple speakers)
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Page 17 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yeah. We commented on it today, already actually, but in the facility at Kato, over
90% of the processes have demonstrated rate there, but we are limited by the
unlucky few that have not. And that's what we're working on. One of them that Elon
mentioned was running the full-scale cathode calendar. We're working through
some improvements that we need to make to that equipment, and to the actual raw
material itself to not have those limitations.
But again, it's an engineering problem. It's not a question of if, it's a question of
when. On the mixing side, we haven't actually really had any challenges specific to
your question. Fundamentally, we're still happy with the dry process direction in
terms of the factory footprint, complexity, utility, consumption, space, and overall
complexity simplification.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And I mean, and the cost associated with everything that I just mentioned.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. We don't have programs [ph] as dry cathode, I mean, it's a -- I don't know,
maybe it's like 10 or 15% of the cost of equipment or something like that? I don't
know, 20% maybe.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. 10%, closer to 10%.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, and so it's like -- just like people don't think like this is like the Messiah or
something, wet versus dry reduces. To dry is like 10% less cost than wet. So it's not --
10%, slow, nothing to sneeze at, especially if you're making hundreds of gigawatt
hours a year. But it's not the Messiah, basically. Yeah.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. We can go to the next question, please.
Operator
Next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Your line is
open.
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. I have another question, actually, on
batteries, but on a slightly different angle. I was wondering how you're looking at
Page 18 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
your sourcing strategy for the 4680. You've talked a lot about all the work you're
doing to develop your in-house production.
But what about asking other battery manufacturers to do 4680 cell with their own
technology? Maybe less innovation than what you guys are lining up internally. And I
was wondering if the first 4680 cells that we see on the road will definitely come
from Tesla's own manufacturing lines, or whether it would be coming actually from
outside suppliers as well. And I have a quick follow-up.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, we are, in fact, working with our existing suppliers to produce 4680 format
cells. And this is just a guess right now. But I see it sort of like consolidating around
4680 nickel-based, structural pack, and for long-range vehicles. And then not
necessarily a 4680 format, but some other format for iron-based cells.
So we right now, we kind of have the Baskin Robbins of batteries situation, where
there's -- we've so many formats and so many chemistries, that it's like we've got like
36 flavors of battery at this point. This is just -- this results in an engineering drag
coefficient where each variants of cell chemistry and format requires, to an amount
of engineering to maintain it and troubleshoot, and this inhibits our forward
progress. So it is going to be important to consolidate to maybe ideally two form
factors, maybe three, but ideally two. And then just one nickel chemistry and one
iron chemistry, so we don't have to troubleshoot so many different variants.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah, and towards that end, we are engaging with the suppliers that we've had good
partnerships with on 4680 designs to enable that new application, and so far so
good. They're working on -- they're bringing their core competencies to bear on
that, we're not mandating like what's going on inside, but it's been a good
collaboration.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. We do expect to see significant increases in supply from our existing suppliers,
in addition to the cells that Tesla's making. So it's both. Sometimes, I get questions
from our cell suppliers like, are we just going to make all the cells ourselves? We're
like, no, please make as many as you possibly can and supply them to us.
We have a significant unmet demand in stationary storage. Megapack is basically
sold out through the end of next year, I believe.
A - Andrew D. Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We have a massive backlog in Powerwall demand, the demand to Powerwall versus
production is an insane mismatch. Now part of that problem is also the
Page 19 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
semiconductor issue. So we used a lot of the same chips in the Powerwall as you do
in a car, so it's like, which one do want to make? Cars or Powerwalls? So we need to
make cars, so therefore Powerwall production has been reduced. But as the
semiconductor shortage is alleviated, then we can massively ramp up Powerwall
production.
I think we have a chance of hitting an annualized rate of a million units of Powerwall
next year, maybe, toward on the order of 20,000 a week. But again, dependent on
cell supply and semiconductors. But in terms of demand, I think there's probably
demand in excess of a million Powerwalls per year. And actually, just a vast amounts
of the Megapacks for utilities.
As we all transition to sustainable energy production, solar and wind are intermittent
and by their nature really need battery packs in order to provide a steady flow of
electricity. And when you look at all the utilities in the world, this is a vast amount of
batteries that are needed. That's why, long term, we really think sort of combined
Tesla and suppliers need to produce at least 1,000 gigawatt hours a year, and maybe
2,000 gigawatt hours a year.
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Thank you. And I have a quick question. I know, Elon, you don't think it's
meaningful today, but I'd be curious to know if you have any thoughts about when
you announced the new pricing on the FSD ring from $10,000 and thrown to $199
without looking. I'd be curious to understand how it affected behavior in issues, so
like a massive effect, affecting the service. And I'm not thinking about people looking
at it as a message, but more to try the most advanced version of autopilots, and to
try it. In the first days, even on the pricing, have you seen like a very significant spike
in the tech rate? And can you give us a sense of how big it was?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay. You're asking like, is the FSD tech rate too expensive and that's why we're
doing subscription? Or I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly?
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
No, my question is from the time you announced like the subscription at $199 the
amounts, how much did the tech rate increase like the (inaudible) people who
basically took the subscription about the new car? So, how it was when they had to
pay 10 grand upfront.
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah. This is Zach here. I think we're still early in understanding how FSD
subscription will unfold. But a couple of data points here. So, we took a look at our
backlog to see customers in our backlog, who have ordered FSD, did they cancel
presumably to go to subscription after they take delivery? And the level of
cancellations there, we're not seeing cannibalization there, it's possible that that
changes, but that was also part of our pricing strategy at $99 and $199.
Page 20 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-07-26
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, and we--
A - Zachary J. Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Also part of our pricing strategy at $99 and $199.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. Like any given price is going to be wrong, so we'll just adjust it over time as we
see the value proposition makes sense to people. So, we're just really -- I'm not
thinking about this a lot right now. We need to make Full Self-Driving work, in order
for it to be a compelling value proposition. Otherwise, people are kind of betting on
the future. Like right now, does it make sense for somebody to do FSD subscription?
I think it's debatable. But once we have Full Self-Driving widely deployed, then the
value proposition will be clear. And at that point, I think basically everyone will use it,
or it could be a rare individual who doesn't.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay, thank you very much for your help. And I think that's all the time we have for
today. Thanks for all your questions, and we'll speak to you again in three months'
time. Have a good day, everyone.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
All right. Thank you.
