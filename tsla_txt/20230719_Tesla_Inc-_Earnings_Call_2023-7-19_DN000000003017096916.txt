Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2023 Q&A
Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by
Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn, and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were
announced at about 3 PM Central Time in the update deck we published at the same
link as this webcast.
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking
statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of
today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one
question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question
queue.
But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-07-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Thank you, Martin. So just a Q2 recap. In Q2, we achieved record vehicle production
and deliveries and record revenue of about $25 billion in a single quarter. And
Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind globally in Q1, surpassing the
likes of Corolla and (inaudible). So it was the number one vehicle of anytime,
including vehicles that are sold at a far lower price. This is, I think, an incredible
achievement by the Tesla team and just a huge thank you to our customers for their
support. So this came in spite of high interest rates and a lot of macro uncertainty
and unless we managed to achieve operating margin of about 10%.
We continue to target 1.8 million vehicle deliveries this year, although we expect that
Q3 production will be a little bit down, because we've got summer shutdowns to --
for a lot of factory upgrades. So just probably a slight decrease in production in Q3
for sort of global factory upgrades. In the long-term, autonomy we think is going to
just drive volume through the ceiling next level. And our future robotaxi products --
the dedicated robotaxi products, we think have a quasi-infinite demand. So, the way
we're going to manufacture the robotaxi is also itself a revolutionary. So it's a
revolutionary sign made in a revolutionary way. It will be by far the highest units per
hour of any vehicle production ever. So we're very excited about that.
With respect to Autopilot and Dojo, in order to build autonomy, we also need to
train our neural net with data from millions of vehicles with a more -- I mean, this is
an improvement over and over again. The more training data you have, the better
the results. And I mean there were times where we see basically in a neural net,
basically it is sort of at a million training examples, it barely works at 2 million, it's
slightly works at 3 million. It's like, wow, okay, we're seeing something, then you get
like 10 million training examples, it's like -- it becomes incredible. So, there's just no
substitute for a massive amount of data. And obviously, Tesla has more vehicles on
the road that are collecting this data than all other companies combined by, I think,
maybe even at an order of magnitude. So, I think we might have 90% of all, a very
big number.
So, the success in AI endeavors is a function of talent, sort of unique data and
computer resources. And we have outstanding capabilities in all three arenas. And I
really just don't know how anyone could do what we're doing, even if they had our
software and had our computer if they did not have the training data.
So speaking of which our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce
the cost of neural net training. It is designed to -- it's not optimized for the kind of
training that we need, which is a video training. So, we just see that the need for
neural net training, again talking in quasi kind of things is just enormous. So, I think
we expect to use both NVIDIA and Dojo to be clear. But there is -- we just see a
demand for really vast training resources.
And we think we may reach in-house neural net training capability of 100 extra
blocks[ph] by the end of next year. So, today, over 300 million miles have been
driven using FSD beta. That 300 million mile number is going to seem small very
quickly. It will soon be billions of miles, and tens of billions of miles. And that FSD will
go from being as good as the human to then being vastly better than the human. We
Page 2 of 22
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-07-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
see a clear path to full self-driving being 10 times safer than the average human
driver.
So -- and between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car,
which we call Hardware 3, 4, but it's really dedicated -- it's a high-efficiency inference
computer that's in the car and our Optimus robot. Tesla is clearly at the cutting-edge
of AI (inaudible).
We continue to build our lease candidates to the Cybertruck on our pilot production
line in Austin. I'm actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory. This is the first truck that
we're aware of that will have four-door, was over six-foot bed and fit into a 20-foot
garage. So it's a sort of biggest on the outside, but it's even bigger on the inside. So
it's a -- I think that's a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel big on
the inside than it looks on the outside. And this is no small car, but we really cared
about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last millimeter. So just
before you trying to get right in middle of the goldilocks zone, not too big, not too
small and then really maximize the utility of the volume. And we can't wait to start
delivering it later this year.
Some other highlights. Our global Supercharging network now stands at over
50,000 -- roughly 50,000 connectors and over 5,000 locations. As I think a lot of
people are aware, the Tesla charging standard which we made open source is now
called the North American charging standard. We're deeply honored that Ford, GM,
Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain
access to our charging network. We strongly believe in helping other car companies
to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing in general. So,
that's (inaudible) there.
Then, if I may I think I want to emphasize like very strongly, this is a very important
point is that Tesla, just as with the North American charging standard, although we're
not licensing, like we're not licensing, we're just making it available, but we are very
open to licensing our Full Self-Driving software and hardware to other car
companies. And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with a major
OEM about using Tesla FSD. So, we're not trying to keep this to ourselves, we're
more than happy to license it to others. And lastly, our new lithium refinery and
cathode facility are progressing well.
In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while
maintaining healthy financials. Our artificial intelligence development is, obviously,
entering a new era. And we're incredibly excited about what's to come. Our other
businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot all started to
become a meaningful contributor to overall profitability this quarter. And then lastly,
I'd just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making it a lot of extra
effort during uncertain times. Thank you very much for your hard work and the
impact you're making.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Thank you very much, Elon. And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.
Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, Q2 was another record quarter of
production and deliveries, as well as records and profit for energy and services and
other businesses. Congratulations again to the Tesla team on the continued
progress. As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest
rates, volatility in consumer confidence and regulatory change, I want to comment
on our financial approach.
First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest
heavily in the core technologies that will drive the long-term value of the business.
This include increasing spending on AI-related technologies such as Full Self-Driving,
Optimus ad Dojo, as well as new products such as Cybertruck, our next-generation
platform in the Semi as evidenced by the continued growth in our R&D spend. This
also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our
vehicle factories, but also our Supercharging network, service, internal applications
and battery processes as we continue with meaningful capital expenditures to lay
this foundation for the future.
Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both our
vehicle and energy business. But most importantly, doing so in a way that generates
the capital to continue our pace of R&D and capital investments. This requires a
strong focus on per unit cost reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as
working capital improvements on raw materials, work-in-process inventory and
customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.
If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a
modest reduction and remained healthy, despite action taken to further improve
vehicle affordability early in the quarter. We recognize -- we realized per unit cost
improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and commodities,
manufacturing costs and logistics. We're also continuing to rapidly increase the build
rate in our Austin and Berlin factories. For our energy business, we improved
margins and gross profit, driven by cost reductions and deal economics, particularly
with Megapack.
As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types
of projects and with specific revenue recognition milestones. As we look forward to
the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon's comments on Q3 volumes, driven by
planned downtimes for factory upgrades. These upgrades will also carry some
amount of factory idle cost, however, we are working to minimize as much as
possible. It's also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro-
environment, which can impact our execution positively or negatively in the near-
term. Regardless, we continue to remain dynamic with a focus on fundamental
efficiency and the long-term outlook. Congratulations again to everybody on a great
quarter.

Questions And Answers
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much, Zach. And let's go to investor questions. The first question on
licensing FSD, we've already answered. So let's go to the second one. The second
question is, what is the status of 4680 cells? How far are you from the specs you laid
out on Battery Day? When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on the Battery
Day?
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah, first I'll just start with a little bit of a production update. So in Texas, 4680 cell
production increased 80% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed 10 million
production cells produced here in Texas. So congrats to the team for that. They're
focused on yield, reduced our scrap bill by 40% quarter-over-quarter. And that
resulted in a 25% reduction in cell COGS. Here in Texas, we're preparing to launch
our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy density than current production. That
was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization. As we scale
cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a
comfortable place on cost per cell.
Against our battery energy density targets, the cyber cell is at our expectations on a
like-for-like electrochemistry basis. We're yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode
production both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring significant further energy
density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on the Battery Day
was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove
to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of
which we are realizing in our Texas scale-up today.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla
Energy products and how you're thinking has evolved on the revenue model? Given
Tesla's AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin
and recurring software margin from auto bidder as this segment accelerates?
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
We can't comment on future product roadmap. But I can provide a quick Energy Q2
update. Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping
successfully to meet our contracted projects in 2023 as stated last quarter Megapack
margins are in a reasonable place in-line with our vehicle target margins. The second
final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule. Eventually doubling
Lathrop capacity ahead of our full factory ramp in 2024. We have several exciting
large projects in construction or nearing completion, putting the KES project in
Hawaii, the Riverina project in Australia, several projects in California and one here
Gigafactory Texas that I'll tour today actually.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with
these projects. On the automotive question we continue to grow automotive
contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK in California with over 6
gigawatt-hours under Tesla's dispatch next year and the UK, our projects performed
best-in the industry. In Q2, auto better does have software margins and is an enabler
for hardware sales, but it's a relatively small contributor to revenues, given how much
deployment growth on the Megapack our side is occurring. It's important to
remember that these large capital projects have lifetimes 20 years of recurring
revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small.
On the residential side, we have some fun things happening. We recently surpassed
0.5 million Powerwall installed. Just this week, we are launching charge on solar,
which allows Tesla Powerwall and vehicle customers to charge their vehicles using
excess solar and drive only on the Sunshine, it's their roof. Yesterday, we began
paying customers in Texas for participating in our virtual power plant to provide
credit support to ERCOT. We expect these credits to lower our medium customers
annual by a third and to increase these credits over-time as ERCOT expanded market
access and today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new model three
owners in Texas, followed by all Texas vehicle customers over the rest of the quarter.
Unfortunately and somewhat similar to Tesla Insurance bringing Tesla, electric and
DPP capabilities to our customers requires working through a fracture and
regulatory environment on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. In the long-run, the
value of residential energy software and hardware will be driven by the level of
market access that utilities market operators and regulators permit. Powerwall
eligible to provide the full stack of energy services like peaker[ph] capacity and
system offerings such as in Australia, we can more than double the value of
ownership relative to a typical system today.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS
per unit from the IRA battery manufacturing incentives and secondly battery raw-
material declines year-to-date.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
I can take that on the first part of the question for IRA manufacturing incentives we've
provided previous guidance that we expect these to being for the course of this year
in the range of $150 million to $250 million per quarter. We are staying within that
boundary as we guided previously, that was the case in Q2 as well. I will note and I
think we've mentioned this before that this includes the 50-50 sharing of credits for
qualified cells from our long-term battery partner Panasonic.
On the commodity side, we are continuing to see improvements there as we've
discussed previously. Lithium is the most notable improvement so-far I think I've
commented on this on the last call because typically we see this coming about a
quarter before it actually is realized in our financials. And also, just as a reminder,
we're not fully exposed to the price of lithium, our supply-chain team has done a
terrific job in partnership with a bunch of other companies to put in-place. Some

long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up-and-
down. That resulted in a 25% reduction in COGS. Here in Texas, we're preparing to
launch our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy density than current
production. That was accomplished through process and mechanical design
optimization as we scale cyber cell production through the end of the year and early

we're not fully exposed to the price of lithium. Our supply chain team has done a
terrific job in partnership with another bunch of other companies to put in place
some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up
and down.
We're also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great. Not as large
as the lithium impacts, but they contribute nonetheless. So if we add up the total
impact of this in Q2 relative to prior quarter, it's about the same size and magnitude
as the IRA benefits that we also received. Just to put this in context, as you look at
COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, there's two things to keep in mind there.
The first is that our SX[ph] mix for deliveries increased quite a bit from Q1 to Q2. So
as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it's important to adjust for that.
And then secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin cars,
which we did quite a bit of that from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above
Model Y production costs elsewhere. And in the quarter, our mix of Austin and Berlin
Page 8 of 22
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-07-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
related builds increased. And so, that's something to consider as you model out the
impact on -- from Q1 to Q2 in terms of COGS per unit.
I do want to ask Karn, if there's anything else on the commodity side or just more
generally you want to adhere.
A - Karn Budhiraj
Yeah. As you mentioned, Zach, we've naturally been a little bit hedged from losing
position because the long-term contracts we have in place, but we have seen
reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into
batteries such as nickel, cobalt and graphite. And the reductions in pricing translate
into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per vehicle impact. We're taking
advantage to extend some of those fixed price contract through the end of the
decade. So it's a playbook that will continue to kind of go back to as we look to the
future.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question on FSD. Have you considered allowing FSD transfer
ability as a lever to allow existing customers to upgrade to a new Tesla instead of
being locked into an existing car due to the price of FSD?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, this is the question we get asked a lot. So we're excited to announce that for
Q3, we will be allowing transfer of FSD. This is a one-time MSD. So this we take
advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within reasonable
delivery time frames. So, yeah, I hope this makes people happy. If we don't get there,
this is a one-time thing.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
All right. The next question, when will we give more information about the
Cybertruck orders, estimated delivery schedules, pricing and specifications?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The demand is so far (inaudible). So that's really not an issue. I do want to emphasize
that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it like a lot. It doesn't look like any
other vehicle because it is not like any other vehicle. So -- and the production ramp
will move as fast as the slowest and least like the elements of the entire supply chain
and internal production. So I wouldn't expect it -- I hope it's smooth. We're certainly
better production ramps. We've got a lot of experience with production ramps, but
first order approximation is like 10,000 unique parts and processes in a year in the
Cybertruck. And if anyone -- it will go as fast as the least lucky, least well-executed
element of the 10,000. So, always very difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think
we're making them in high volume next year and we will be delivering the car this
year.

Thank you. The next question is critics of Giga casting contended that process makes
vehicles harder and more costly to repair, essentially pushing costs on to the
customer. Can you share some details about the initial repair experience with Giga
cast vehicles?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
That must be why everyone's copying us.
A - Lars Moravy {BIO 22525342 <GO>}
Thanks, Elon. This is Lars. That's like simply not true. There's a misconception that
traditional bodies are easy to repair, but they are made of multiple materials and
multiple joining methods. Spot welds and rivets have to be drilled out. Panels and
structural adhesives have to be chiseled down, dried adhesive has to be removed,
stain things, cut, blah, blah, blah.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
It's a crazy patchwork quilt.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. And so, putting that back together means time and money using an example
of replacing a real cash rail in Model Y. It's a do that versus like what we replaced it
with some Model 3, it's 10 times cheaper and three times faster to do it with the cash
rail.
My design team works with our collision repair team since we're closed-loop on this
with insurance and redesign specific parts that are making it easier and faster to
repair. And we have an incentive to do that because we have our own insurance and
our own body shops. We expect that we'll continue to do this, and collision repair
will continue to become cheaper and faster over time. And we already made this
available to all body shops through our Tesla-approved body shop training.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah. Closing loop on collision repair and factoring that into design is a big deal.
A - Lars Moravy {BIO 22525342 <GO>}
It's crucial. I don't think anyone else can do it with that ecosystem that we have, so...
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. And we are actually able to change the details of the casting with inserts and
we actually do that all the time, so -- because the answer is actually wear out and
need to be replaced anyway. So we can actually make design changes to be inserts
and tweak the castings. But the cancel -- the cast rear body or front body is lighter,
cheaper, better noise vibration, harshness, much easier to manufacture. And it's
better in every way. And that's why so many other car companies are copying us.

A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Probably.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, they certainly put out lot of press releases about it. I think it's basically going to
be how all cars are made in the future.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. Next question, how many Optimus bots have been made and when will
they be able to start performing useful tasks?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
10 million. Yes, I think we're around five or six bots. There is -- we were 10, I guess,
which was our -- how many are working and what phase, but, it's sort of -- yeah, there
is more every month. There's a lot of interesting things about the Optimus bot. We
found that there are actually no suppliers that can produce the actuators. There are
no off-the-shelf actuators that work well for human robot at any price.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Certainly not compelling unit.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, there's not human robot that can do some things that human can to do. So,
we've actually had to design our own actuators that integrate the motor, the power
electronics, the controller, the sensors and really every one of them is custom
designed. So, and then of course, we'll be using the same inference hardware as the
car.
So -- but we are in designing these actuators are designing them for volume
productions. So they're not just lighter, tighter and more capable any other actuators
that exist in the world, but it's also actually manufacturable. So we should be able to
make them in volume. The first Optimus that is -- that we'll have all of the Tesla-
designed actuators, so production candidate actuators. It integrated and walking
should be around November-ish. So -- and then, we will start ramping up after that.
In terms of when we'll be able to see some useful things, we will first be trying to in
our own factories, and is proving out as utility buy. I think we'll be able to have do
something useful in our factories sometime next year. I would be -- yeah, I'm pretty
confident of that. So, yeah, very well.
I should say, another core thing about Optimus is that just in the US alone, there are
2 million amputees. And I was just talking to the Neuralink team and by combining
Neuralink implant and a robotic arm or leg for someone that has had their arms or

body that is incredibly capable. $6 million man in real life. But it won't cost $6 million,
$60,000 man. Seems that was impressive, but it will actually -- so that actually could
be really -- I think would be incredible to potentially help millions of people around
the world and give them a robot arm or like that is as good, maybe long-term better
than a biological one.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question is how has the order intake trended relatively to
production levels during Q2? And how has that trended in the quarter-to-date
period? Conceptually, how does Tesla beside? When do you see the appropriate
reduced prices or add other sales incentives to increase demand?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. I guess, demand has roughly tracked production. So -- which is what we aim
for. Something that we have that really I think no other car maker has is that we have
real-time demand and real-time production like so -- seven days a week. I got an
email -- auto generated email, chose output from all factories and orders globally. So
it's like a real-time finger on the pulse of Earth basically. And we're just course
according to what the mood of the public is. Buying a new car is a big decision for
the vast majority of people. So, anytime there is economic uncertainty, people
generally pause on new car buying at least to see what happens.
And then obviously, another challenge is the interest rate environment. As interest
rates rise, the affordability of anything bought with that decreases, so effectively
increasing the price of the car. So when interest rates rise dramatically, we actually
have to reduce the price of the car, because the interest payments increase the price
of the car. So -- and this is at least up until recently, it was just I believe the sharpest
interest rate rise in history. So we have to do something about that.
And so, (inaudible) a crystal ball for the global economy. I really appreciate it, if I
could borrow that crystal ball. Yeah, exactly, (inaudible). It should be not on Twitter.
So, I mean, one day, it seems like the world economy is falling apart. And the next
day, everything's fine. I don't know what the hell is going on. It would be totally fine. I
wish I did.
So I mean, that's why I say like I always on twitter, I posted like just really advising
because I care a lot about the sort of the small shareholders, especially ones that
have stuck with us through thick and thin. I love you guys. And so, we can't control
these macro shocks or the thematic depressive nature of the stock market. So that's
why I recommend against margin loans in times that are turbulent. If times are not
that turbulent, actually margin loan can be a smart move within reason. But we're in I
would call it turbulent times. Like I have very high confidence in the long-term value
of Tesla. Like I see it really see a path to a 10x -- call it a 5x increase in the value of the
Company, maybe a 10x.
And where things go along the way, the trials and tribulations and the mood of the
markets, no one can't predict. And so, the old adage of buy and hold is right. For an
investment advice, I see like identify a company whose products you love. See if they
Page 12 of 22
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-07-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
-- does it seem like they will continue to make good products or great products. Buy
that stock and hold it That's it. You all win. The reason companies exist is to make
goods and services ideally great goods and services. They don't exist for any other
reason, they shouldn't. So that's why you should buy the stock of the company that
makes -- has a great future pipeline. It's common sense actually.
And then, generally if you see -- if you -- provided you're confident about what that
company's products or services are, when the market panics buy and when the
market is over the exuberant, you can sell. I'm not recommending yourself
(inaudible), but yeah, buy low, sell high. Warren Buffett actually I think has a saying
I'm paraphrasing him, but publicly-traded company is like imagine you're living in
your house and some crazy manic depressive guy comes and stands at the outside
your house and yells property prices at you. And it's a different price every day. The
house is still the same house. So, this is the stock market. Credit that to Warren
Buffett.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. Let's go to the next question. With the emphasis of price cuts to drive
volume growth heading into automotive gross margin, can investors expect to see
automotive gross margin stabilize or even rise due to efficiencies, outpacing the
cuts? And if, so when?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Where is that crystal ball, again? If I may, it's like look the short-term variances in
gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture.
Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly. I'd recommend looking at ARK
invest, I think their analysis is very good. The best -- and generally for Intuit or like if
the finance, smart finance people on Twitter, follow their accounts, they're great. So
that's in my opinion where you will get the best, the best info. So I strongly believe
Tesla is a big long-term investment. And that's where when things go up and down,
in fact the market panics by, if the market is a little too exuberant time, sell at the
time, but just generally, I feel comfortable we will deliver long-term, but can't control
short-term, so -- and it's autonomy is really where it's happening. I mean, Zach why
don't you?
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
I fully agree with you. I think the only thing in the short-term that matters is what I
said in my opening remarks, which is regenerating enough money to continue to
invest. And the portfolio of products and technologies that the technical teams are
investing in right now, this is intense. It's intense in terms of investment. It's intense in
terms of potential
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Frankly, I think it's ridiculous that we have positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive
business, while investing massive amounts of money in new technology. That is
super hard.
Page 13 of 22
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-07-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And vertical integration. It's not even just like new products, but also...
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. We actually make our ship. We don't -- to others, but...
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
And so, at least from my perspective, what matters is continuing to generate the cash
to invest. That means continuing to be hyper-focused on near-term cost reduction
because everything we do and near-term cost reduction provides capital to reinvest.
Hyper-focused on working capital management, which we've made quite a bit of
progress there on the raw materials and led side of that. We've been very focused
on accounts receivables as well to ensure that we can continue to invest -- reinvest
the cash. This is what we're focused on.
And so there's set of things that we control. We have a pipeline of cost reductions.
We are getting tailwinds in the commodity space right now as Karn mentioned, that's
helpful. Variability around average selling prices goes back to Elon's point, we don't
control interest rates, we don't control macro consumer sentiment, but we have an
obligation to be responsive to that to ensure that we're matching supply and
demand and keeping things balanced. And so, this is how we're managing the next
handful of quarters. As soon as these quarters will be behind us, they won't be part
of present value of future cash flows of the business. And so, we want to make sure
we keep that view and make sure that the long-term business is exactly the way that
we want it to be.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
All right. Thank you very much. And now let's go to analyst questions. The first
question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays. Dan, feel free to unmute yourself.
Q - Dan Levy {BIO 17519730 <GO>}
Great. Good evening. Thank you. Wanted to start first with a question about your
efforts in AI and Dojo. It's pretty clear it sounds like you're accelerating your focus.
Can you maybe provide us with a sense of what the processes of refining a product?
Is it more machines? And maybe you could give us a sense of when the payout starts
to -- when you start to see the payout and what the resource outlay is? What should
we expect on the OpEx front, as a result of this?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sorry, are you saying how much we can spend on Dojo or...
Q - Dan Levy {BIO 17519730 <GO>}
Yeah.
Page 14 of 22
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-07-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
R&D of Dojo.
Q - Dan Levy {BIO 17519730 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, we're not going to be open loop on our Dojo expenditures, so -- but I mean, I
think we will be spending probably worth of $1 billion over the next year on
(inaudible) next year. it's well over $1 billion in Dojo. And yeah, so maybe we've got a
truly staggering amount of video data to do training on. And this is another thing I
like. In order to copy us, you also need to spend billions of dollars in -- on training
compute. I mean, it's like -- and it's also hard too. You need the data and you need
the trend computers like things like all things needed to actually achieve this at-scale
to generalized solution for autonomy. This is one of the highest bonds ever.
You see a lot of AI companies doing LLMs and whatnot. And I'd say if there are so
great, why can't they make a software driving car because it's harder. That's why. So, I
do think that -- I think there's some great AI companies out there, but just
fundamentally, the staggering amount of data we've got to process -- we've got to
process somehow and custom silicon is the best way to do that. So that's what Dojo
is designed to do is optimize for video training. It's not optimized for all of them. So
it's optimized for video training. With video training, you have a much higher ratio of
compute to memory bandwidth. So, whereas LLMs tend to be memory bandwidth
choked.
So that's it. I mean -- but like I said, we're also -- we have some -- we're using a lot of
NVIDIA hardware and we'll continue to -- we'll actually take NVIDIA hardware as fast
as NVIDIA will deliver it to us tremendous respect for Jensen and NVIDIA. They've
done an incredible job. And frankly, I don't have -- if they could deliver us enough,
GPUs -- we might not need Dojo, but they can't. So, they've got so many customers.
They've have been kind of up to nonetheless, prioritizing our GPU orders. But the
sheer magnitude of video training -- because like I said, we're not trying to just get
as good as when we want to get to 10 times better than human, maybe a 100 times
than human.
Right now, I believe there is something on the order of 1 million automotive tests per
year. And then if you say permanent serious injuries, I think it's probably closer to 10
million per year. And, yes, so it matters if you're twice as good as human 10 times,
like 10 times better than human would still mean 100,000 deaths and 1 million severe
permanent injuries. So it's like okay, we would probably be 100 times better. So
there's really -- it's a march of lines and we want to achieve. That's perfect to safety as
possible. And that's truly mind-boggling amounts of video and computer needed for
that. So -- and then, I just do think there's other applications for Dojo, but we just
desperately needed for the video training.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Just to add to what Elon mentioned, the numbers that he mentioned are between
R&D spend and capital spend and this is moving quickly. And so, we provide a three-
year outlook on our capital expense. We are considering these expenses in that
outlook. And as that moves up and down, we'll continue to update our guidance in
the queue.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. I want to say the fundamental rate limiter on the progress of full self-driving is
training. That's -- if we had more training compute, we will get it done faster. So,
that's it.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
And it's just difficult to predict how quickly we can execute on them.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Great, thank you. Just as a follow-up. I recognize there's incredible macro uncertainty
right now, but you're sticking with your near-term, your volume target 50% CAGR. As
we just think about sort of in the year ahead Cybertruck is going to be some
contribution, there's going to be some help from further EV penetration growth. But
to what extent, are you willing to sacrifice on pricing to keep that 50% volume CAGR
intact? Or are you thinking differently about margins versus your prior commentary
of willing to sacrifice on margins to get more share?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It sounds like we're getting more share. It's just that you can think of every car that
we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually something that in the
future may be worth as much as five times what it is today. Because average
(inaudible) vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving a week. If this is 1.5 hours a
day on average, that's 10 hours a week-ish. If you've got on autonomous, if the
vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or
partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be
used by others, sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb with a room
in your house. The value is just tremendous. So I think it's sort of, it would be -- I think
it makes -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles
because we think in the -- not just in the future, they will have a dramatic valuation
increase. I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point in which we can upload full
self-driving and is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in
asset value maybe in history.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. Let's go to the next analyst. The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner
from Deutsche Bank.
Q - Emmanuel Rosner {BIO 16323493 <GO>}
Page 16 of 22
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-07-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Thank you very much. Two questions from me as well. First, following up on the
autonomy. So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles on
existing vehicles, you're improving FSD incrementally. What is your latest targeted
timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would
trigger much higher take rates? And will Tesla benefit from lowering the price of
FSD?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have
made fun of me, my predictions about achieving full self-driving have been
optimistic in the past. The reason I've been optimistic is what -- it tends to look like is
the -- we'll make rapid progress with a new version of FSD, but then, it will curve over
logarithmically. So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward
line, diagonally up. And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing. But
then because it's actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a
series of stacked logarithmic curves.
Now I'm the boy who cried FSD, but I think we'll be better than human by the end of
this year. That's not to say we're approved by regulators. And I'm saying that would
be in the U.S. because we've got to focus on one market first. But I think we'll be
better than human by the end of this year. I've been wrong in the past, I may be
wrong this time. And the price of FSD -- so the way I think is the price of FSD is
actually very low is not high. When you go back to what I say here, the value of the
car increased dramatically if it is actually autonomous. $15,000 is actually a low price,
not a high price. And we will offer -- and we have -- I think we do sort of offer FSD as
a sort of monthly subscription, although most people don't know that. So I'd
recommend like maybe trying it out as a monthly subscription, so you don't have to
go with the $13,000[ph] thing. But I think yeah, obviously, if the car is worth several
times its original price, $15,000 is actually a low price for FSD.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. And the next question comes from William Stein from Truist. William, go
ahead and unmute.
Q - William Stein {BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I'd like to ask about, to stick on
this AI topic, we've read with great interest the developments in Dojo today and you
spoken about FSD. But you've also, Elon, you've started this X.AI company and for
investors that think that there might be quite a bit of value in the AI features and
products of Tesla. It might be concerning to see you pursuing another endeavor
where AI is the focus. So can you talk about how X.AI might overlap, might perhaps
compete with Tesla or in other ways, perhaps it enhances the value of what Tesla
does? Thanks very much.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. I think it will actually enhance the value of Tesla. There were just some of the
world's best AI engineers and scientists that we're willing to join a startup. But they
Page 17 of 22
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-07-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
are not willing to join a large sort of relatively established company like Tesla, so is
like that's actually how it got started. I was interviewing a few people and they're like
now we want to start-up was like. And that's what -- I can convince them strain Tesla.
So it's like, okay, well better to startup that (inaudible) has been done then they go
work somewhere else.
That's kind of the genesis of xAI. And xAI is focused on sort of AGI. Yeah, so it's, I'd
like say, I think there will be some value that xAI brings to Tesla, also some of the best
for the very best people in the world, they really just want to work on interesting
problem. So if you take say, a material science group, really what convinced try
equivalent to leave Apple, where it's very happy and well compensated and both at -
- book look. We think it's the best material science group in the world well, was that
he got to work both Tesla and SpaceX, he wasn't willing to leave Apple if it was Tesla,
but he is willing to do if it is Tesla and SpaceX. So sometimes you get the best talent
in the world. That's kind of the thing you need to do, and that actually has been very
beneficial to Tesla.
Q - William Stein {BIO 15106707 <GO>}
If I can squeeze one more mundane question in. I wonder if you think you can hit the
1.8 million unit number with current pricing, or do you anticipate needing to
continue to lower prices because it seems like the trends have stabilized in the last
maybe more than half? Should we expect to sort of continued decreases, or more
stabilization for the rest of the year?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. We have sort of -- we started the referral program, which I think will be quite
effective. As Zach was saying earlier, we don't control the macroeconomic
conditions. So if interest rates continue to rise, that reduces the affordability of cars.
And for a lot of people, they're really (inaudible) really breaking even every month. In
fact, if you look at the rise in credit card debt, they are in fact not breaking even
every month. Credit card debt is looking scary. So we just don't control the market
conditions. If market condition is stable, I think prices will be stable. If they're not
stable, then we would have lower prices, yeah.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. Let's go to Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Thanks so much, guys. As you're building out Dojo and implementing what truly is
going to be highly complex set of software, if you speak to the maturity of the
operating system and how much outsourced software you're expecting to use in that
system?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
This is a custom software stack. So -- but it is designed such that you can run at a
high level, PyTorch and Jax. So -- but then, we have to customize it to actually run on
Page 18 of 22
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-07-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
a custom silicon. So the software stack is a combination of open source software and
then Tesla software all the way to the bare silicon, which is the case for the inference
computer in the car.
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Okay, thanks so much. That's super helpful. Then can you speak to how you're
managing some of the geopolitical risks relative to your capacity expansion?
Obviously, as you guys continue to grow at this rate, you're going to be putting
some folks out of business. And then, there's going to be some impacts around
regional economy. So just want to understand how you're thinking about that in
terms of some of your CapEx plans and how you're arranging some of those
relationships with different countries and regions?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
This is a period of unusual geopolitical risk. So, I think we're -- the best we can do is
have factories in many parts of the world, such that if things get difficult in one part
of the world, we can still keep things going in the rest of world.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
Q - Mark Delaney {BIO 17231530 <GO>}
Hi. Thank you very much for taking the question. Tesla has been making progress
reducing cost and did so again last quarter. Can you give an update on when you
think automotive COGS per vehicle could be under the historical $36,000 per
vehicle level, and what are the key puts and takes to get there?
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
This is -- I think I was asked this in the past. This is very difficult to forecast. There is a
series of costs that we manage. There's series of costs in which we don't control. And
so, particularly on the commodity side, where labor cost et cetera, it's just hard to
say.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. And we saw very inflationary pressures -- like strong inflationary pressures for a
while last year. And now -- which obviously makes it very difficult to reduce COGS.
And now we're seeing what seems to be deflationary pressures, certainly
deflationary -- deflation is a pressure. But we're seeing commodity prices dropping
as was mentioned, as Karn mentioned a moment ago. And I mean, what do you
think? I mean, basically, the trends seem to be deflationary at the commodity level.
A - Karn Budhiraj
Definitely, there's that. And then, there's also the unit economics improve as volumes
grow. That's the other thing we're seeing. As we're becoming a bigger and better
part of a lot of suppliers, the economies of scale come into play. There's equipment
Page 19 of 22
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-07-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
depreciation that comes into play, equipment that was commissioned five to seven
years ago. That used to be a part of the piece price. That's completely amortized. So,
we'll see situation where piece price comes down because that equipment
contribution has gone away. And then, just we continue to have this mentality of
continuous improvement in terms of labor, reducing labor, improving automation,
and just continue to get better at what we do. So we have seen -- I think every
quarter, we have seen an improvement. Of course, the commodities spiked up and
down. Just in general, the trend is towards being more efficient.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah. I'm totally agreeing.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Lithium prices went absolutely insane there for a while.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah, and they're recovering now.
A - Karn Budhiraj
(inaudible) it used to be.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
And we're still early in the ramps -- well, not early in the ramp, but early in the cost
down curve of Austin and Berlin. And so, it takes time to work the cost out of it. First,
it's a focus on ramp, ramp it brings cost down...
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
And quality cost.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah, and then once that stabilizes, we can divert bandwidth to cost reduction. And
so, Austin and Berlin saw quite a decent amount of cost reduction on a fundamental
basis from Q1 to Q2. We'll continue to do that work, that would be helpful. And so,
we're just going to keep chipping away at it.
A - Karn Budhiraj
Packaging is a big element to that.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, logistics too.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Logistics is normalizing, which is great.
Page 20 of 22
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-07-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
(inaudible) utilization, something that team has been very focused on. So every bit of
it.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah, and...
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Logistics is under-appreciated. Yeah, so I was (inaudible) like valves and tactics was
one logistics.
A - Karn Budhiraj
And we've made tremendous improvements in cost in all fronts expect costs. We
have done pre-pandemic expect cost level to, and our goal is to go further down.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah, so when we look at our progress from Q1 to Q2 on cost, whether we look at
internally, normalized for the impacts of mix-shift with Austin and Berlin being a
higher percentage of our mix normalized for S&X being a higher percentage of our
mix in Q2 versus Q1. The sequential cost reduction, it might be the largest we've had
in a while. So I think it's great work on behalf of the Tesla team, and we just got to
keep it up.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, it's a game of pennies. So Game of Thrones with pennies.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Mark, do you have a follow-up question. I think you're muted.
Q - Mark Delaney {BIO 17231530 <GO>}
Yeah. Thank you very much for all the details on that. Maybe you could put a finer
point on the downtime impact that you spoke about in your prepared comments in
terms of production impact. And then also to what extent, there is a margin impact
from those factory upgrades that you're planning this quarter? Thank you.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah, the downtime, we don't know exactly the number of cars impacted because
kind of the way that we go into downtime windows for upgrades is we set aside a
period of time, but then the team is challenged to go as quickly as possible, so that
we can get the factory is up and running again and minimize cost. So it's not a
profound reduction. Hopefully, it's small.
