Presentation
Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2023 Q&A
Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by
Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were
announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time in the update that we published at the
same link as this webcast.
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking
statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of
today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one
question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question
queue. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
Elon?
Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Thank you, Martin. So just a Q3 recap. Last quarter was impacted by downtime for
global factory upgrades that will help us reduce cost per vehicle as well as increase
production. We remain focused on three main objectives, which is the cost reduction
Page 1 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-18
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
of our products, investments in artificial intelligence, and other growth projects like
Optimus, and continued free cash flow generation.
Regarding vehicle cost, our team was able to reduce the cost per vehicle further in
Q3 despite headwinds from factory idle costs and ramp-up of new factories, and we
believe there's still a meaningful room for improvement there. Regarding Autopilot
and AI, our vehicles now driven over 0.5 billion miles with FSD beta, Full Self-Driving
beta, and that number is growing rapidly. We recently completed a 10,000 GPU
cluster of H100s. We think probably bringing it into operation faster than anyone's
ever brought that much compute per unit time into production, since training is the
fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.
We're also seeing significant promise with FSD version 12 versus the end-to-end AI
where its photon count-in controls out, or really you can think of it as there's just a
large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing reality into a
very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work. The vast
majority of human data input is optics from our eyes, and so we are like the car,
photons in, controls out, with neural nets -- just neural nets in the middle. It's very
interesting to think about that.
We will continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass
game-changer. And, I mean, success in this regard in the long term, I think, has the
potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far. If you have
fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly
useful, it's not clear what the limit is.
Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy -- of storage
products in Q3. And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our
highest margin business. Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to
quarterly profit.
The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck. I am too.
I've driven the car. It's an amazing product. I do want to emphasize that there will be
enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then
in making the Cybertruck cash flow positive. This is simply normal for, when you've
got a product with a lot of new technology, or any new vehicle -- brand new vehicle
program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you
will have problems proportionate to how many new things you're trying to solve at
scale. So I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product
ever, and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work
to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can
afford.
Often people do not understand what is truly hard. That is why I say prototypes are
easy, production is hard. People think it's the idea or you make a prototype, you
design a car. And as soon as they're designing a car, it's just anyone can do it, it does
require taste, it does require effort to design a prototype. But the difficulty going
Page 2 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-18
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
from a prototype to volume production is like 10,000% harder to get to volume
production than to make the prototype in a first place. And then it is even harder
than that to reach positive cash flow. That is why there have not been new car
startups that have been successful for 100 years, apart from Tesla.
So I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck. It's a great product, but
financially, it will take, I don't know, a year to 18 months before it is a significant
positive cash flow contributor. I wish there was some way for that to be different, but
that's my best guess. So really the demand is off the charts. We have over 1 million
people who have reserved the car. So it's not a demand issue, but we have to make
it, and we need to make it at a price that people can afford. Insanely difficult things.
In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining
positive cash flow, and we continue to target and expect to have around 1.8 million
vehicle deliveries, as stated earlier this year. The Tesla AI team is, I think, one of the
world's best, and I think it is actually by far the world's best when it comes to real-
world AI. I'll say that again, Tesla has the best real-world AI team on earth, period.
And it's getting better.
And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees, who are making a lot of extra
effort during uncertain times. Thank you very much for your hard work and the
impact that you're making.
Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much, Elon. And our CFO, Vaibhav, had some opening remarks as
well.
Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
Thanks, Martin. Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet
another record quarter of profitability in our energy business. Congratulations to the
Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence, as we navigate
through a period of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting
consumer sentiment. As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial
performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory upgrades. This
was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate
increases.
Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately
$37,500. We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight. Reducing the cost
of our vehicles is our top priority.
On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck
prototype builds and pilot production testing combined with spend on AI
technologies like Full Self-Driving, Optimus, and Dojo. We have and will continue to
make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&D will
continue to grow in the near term. However, our focus is to continue making
Page 3 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-18
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
investments through positive cash flow from operations. This year itself, we have
generated operating cash flows of approximately $8.9 billion and free cash flows of
approximately $2.3 billion.
Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis, with
energy business leading the charge primarily from the growth in megabyte
deployments. Our services and other businesses, on a year-on-year basis, also
continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from our growing fleet. As
regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to
elaborate that most car buying happens with one or other form of financing, and
hence, we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer.
And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us
to adjust the price of our vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity. We have tried to
offset such adjustments via a focus on reducing costs. However, there is an inherent
lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins. To that extent, we recently
announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S., whereby you can get a
standard range Model Y for as low as $399 a month.
In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we're
focused on reducing costs, maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making
investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next-generation platforms. We
believe this strategy positions us well for the long term. Once again, I would like to
thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.
Questions And Answers
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
Thank you very much. And now let's go to investor questions. The first investor
question comes from Craig. How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for
2024?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's difficult to make an accurate guess at this point. Going back to what I said earlier
that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult, and like I said, there's no way around
that. If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which
there are literally 200 models that are slight variations on a theme in the combustion
engine world, just distinctions without a difference, then it's really not that hard. But if
you want to do something radical and innovative, and something really special like
the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult, because there's nothing to copy. You have to
invent not just the car, but the way to make the car. So the more uncharted the
territory, the less predictable the outcome.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-18
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Now I can say that if you say, well, where will things end up? I think, we'll end up with
roughly 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year. And -- but I don't think we're going to reach
that output rate next year. I think we'll probably reach it sometime in 2025. That's my
best guess.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The second question is, can you provide a progress update on the 4680
cell, particularly progress towards performance improvements and cost savings you
outlined on Battery Day? Thank you.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Sure thing, Martin. 4680 cell production in Texas increased 40% quarter-over-
quarter. Congrats to the Texas team for producing their 20 million cell off of line one.
Texas is now our primary 4680 facility. We're heavily focused on quality. Scrap is
down 40% quarter-over-quarter. With the increased volume and yield improvements,
cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the quarter, although we
have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals. And that is our priority.
The Cybertruck cell with 10% higher energy than our Model Y cell started production
on line two in Texas. This quarter, we convert to building 100% Cybertruck cells to
simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four lines in Phase 1 over the next three
quarters. Phase 2 of the Texas 4680 facility is currently under construction. The
additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase 1, and our
target is for them to start producing in late 2024.
Lastly, in Kato, we're retooling to enable large-scale pilot runs of our next generation
cell designs. Kato's long-term goal is to be the launchpad for new cells, one
generation ahead of our mass production facilities, enabling faster iteration and
smoother ramp-ups of new designs.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question from institutional investor is, could you please provide
an update on capacity expansion plans for companies, factories in Berlin and Austin,
and the opening schedule of Gigafactory in Mexico?
A - Unidentified Speaker
Berlin and Austin factories, the current priority is actually maximize the output from
our existing lines by laser focus on efficiency improvement. As always, maintaining a
high quality and reducing per unit cost will be as critical as growing production
volume.
For Mexico, we're working on infrastructure and factory design in parallel with the
engineering and development of the new production that we(cid:0)ll be manufacturing
there. That's all I can share for now.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Page 5 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-18
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
In Mexico, we're laying the groundwork to begin construction. And doing all the
long lead items. But I think we want to just get a sense for what the global economy
is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico factory. I'm worried about the high interest
rate environment that we're in. It's -- I just can't emphasize this enough that the vast
majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment, and as interest rates
rise, the proportion of that monthly payment as interest increases naturally. So if
interest rates remain high, or if they go even higher, it's that much harder for people
to buy the car. They simply can't afford it.
So -- and we are tracking, I believe at this point, for Model Y to be the best-selling car
on earth, but not just in revenue, but in unit volume. If you compare that to the other
vehicles that are number 2 and number three and whatnot, they cost much less than
our car. So, we're just hitting law of large numbers situations here.
I know people want us to advertise and we are advertising. I think there is some --
there's something to be gained on the advertising front. I don't think it's nothing. But
informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn't really help.
And -- so that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable, or
the average person cannot buy it for any amount of money. They can't afford it. They
can't afford it. So this is big deal.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay, thank you very much. The next question is, when do you expect Model 3
Highland to be available in the U.S.? I just wanted to address that, unfortunately, we
don't answer product-related questions and timings on earnings calls, so let's go to
the next one.
Current sell-side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in
2024, representing 28% growth versus 2023 guidance. Is this growth rate achievable
without any mass market launches in 2024, and when does Tesla expect to return to
its 50% long-term CAGR?
A - Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
Thanks for the question. When you look at 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces.
Elon just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment. So
we're focused on growing our volumes in a very cost-efficient manner and are
carefully reviewing all our options, and we'll be able to provide a much more
meaningful update at our next earnings call.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, the risk is stating the obvious. It's not possible to have a compound
growth rate of 50% forever, or you will exceed the mass of the known universe. So --
but I think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any other car company on
earth by far.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-18
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Thank you. Next question is, do you have an approximate timeline in mind for the
robotaxi, driven or non-driven? What excites you most about how this project is
progressing?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, robotaxi is like necessarily non-driven. I guess I'm very excited about our
progress with autonomy and the end-to-end, nothing but nets, self-driving software
is amazing. Drives me all around Austin with no interventions. So it's clearly the right
move. And so it's really pretty amazing. And obviously that same software and
approach will enable Optimus to do useful things and enable Optimus to learn how
to do things simply by looking. So an extremely exciting in the long term.
As I mentioned before, given that economic output is a number of people times
productivity. If you no longer have a constraint on people, effectively you've got a
humanoid robot that can do as much as you'd like, your economy is quasi-infinite, or
infinite for all intents and purposes. So I don't think anyone's going to do it better
than Tesla, not by a long shot. Boston Dynamics is impressive, but their robot lacks a
brain. They're like the Wizard of Oz or whatever.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
(inaudible)
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, lacks the brain. And then, you also need to be able to design the humanoid
robot in such a way that it can be mass manufactured. And then at some point the
robots will manufacture the robots. Now obviously we need to make sure that there's
a good place for humans in that future, that we do not create some variance of the
Terminator outcome. So we're going to put a lot of effort into localized control of the
humanoid robot. So basically anyone will be able to shut it off locally. And you can't
change that even if you put -- like a software update, you can't change that. It has to
be hard-coded.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD, if it is getting
better and robotaxi is expected so soon?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable, so more people could try it. Yes. But
I think over time the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value, so it would
regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question is again on FSD. Mercedes is accepting legal liability
for when its Level 3 autonomous driving system drive pilot is active. Is Tesla planning
to accept legal liability for FSD? And if so, when?
Page 7 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-18
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, there's a lot of people that assume we have legal liability, judging by the
lawsuits. We're certainly not being let that off the hook on that front, whether we
would like to or wouldn't like to. So --
A - Unidentified Speaker
I mean, I think it's important to remember for everyone that Mercedes' system is
limited to roads in Nevada and some certain cities in California. It doesn't work in the
snow or the fog. They must have a lead car and marked lanes, only 40 miles per
hour. Our system is meant to be holistic and drive in any condition, so we obviously
have a much more capable approach, but with those kind of limitations, it's really not
very useful.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think some people understand the profundity of the Tesla AI system, but it's very,
very few. It's basically baby AGI. It has to understand reality in order to drive, baby
AGI.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question on Optimus. Will Optimus be working on Gigafactory
lines next year? If so, how many would you guess will be deployed?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think at this point, we are not ready to discuss details of the Optimus program, but
we will make -- provide periodic updates online. So as you can see, where Optimus a
year ago could barely walk, and now it can do yoga. So a few years from now it can
probably do ballet.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Sounds good. And the last question from investors is, neural net path planning
represents a significant advance in capability and safety for FSD. What steps is Tesla
taking to make this technology available outside the U.S.?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Our approach has been to try to get it, like the more places we(cid:0)re trying to
make it work, the harder the problem is. And so the reason we don't do it in all
countries simultaneously is that it would take much longer to make it work anywhere
at all. So that's why it's currently just North America. And also for most parts of the
world, you have to get approval before deploying things, whereas in the U.S., you
can deploy things at risk or at least you take liability for what you deploy. So it's --
whereas most countries require some sort of extensive approval program.
So we only want to go through that extensive approval program when we think it's
kind of ready for prime time in that country. I apologize it's not out in those
Page 8 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-18
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
countries, but we keep finding ways to make it better. And I -- it really -- it needs to
drive such that it exceeds the, even unsupervised, significantly exceeds the
probability of injury of a human, or significantly better, a lower probability of injury
than a human by far.
I think we're tracking to that point very quickly. Obviously in the past, I've been
overly optimistic about this. The reason I've been overly optimistic is that the
progress tends to sort of look like a log curve, which is that you have kind of rapid
initial improvements, and that if you were to extrapolate that rapid, fairly linear rate
of improvement, you get to self-driving quite quickly, but then the rate of
improvement curves over logarithmically exhaust the asymptote. That's not
happened several times. I would characterize our progress in real-world AI as a
series of stacked log curves.
I think that is also true in other parts of AI, like LLMs and whatnot, a series of stacked
log curves. Each log curve gets higher than the last one, so if you keep stacking logs,
eventually you get to FSD.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. Let's now go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Will
Stein from Truist. Will, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Q - William Stein {BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Great. Thanks so much for taking my question, and thanks for all the updates today.
We learned earlier in the call, it sounds like you don't think the truck will ramp to
significant volume until its third year of production. Should we have a similar
anticipation for the ramp of the next-gen platform, or is there any reason that we
should be maybe more optimistic or pessimistic about the ramp profile there? Thank
you.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, to be clear, it's not really the third year of production, it's kind of like the
18 month of production, it's roughly my guess. So it's just that it'll happen. It starts
this year, spans next year, and gets to 2025. So technically there are three calendar
years in there, but there's actually only 18 months, not three years. I would be very
disappointed if it took us -- that would be shocking if it took us three years. But 18
months from initial deliveries to reach volume and reach prosperity was an immense
-- I can't tell you how much, the blood, sweat, and tears level required to achieve that
is just staggering. I've been through it many times, and then here we go again.
Q - William Stein {BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Similar path for the next-gen platform?
A - Unidentified Speaker
I mean, there's like unique complexity to Cybertruck.
Page 9 of 21

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Q - William Stein {BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I mean, Cybertruck is (inaudible). Yes, I mean, we dug our own grave with
Cybertruck. Nobody -- in general, nobody digs their own grave better than
themselves. And so, it is -- Cybertruck's one of those special products that comes
along only once in a long while. And special products that come along once in a
long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to reach volume, to be
prosperous. It's fundamental to the nature of the newness. So now the sort of high
volume, low cost, smaller vehicle is actually much more conventional.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Yes. In terms of the technologies we're putting into it, we didn't have to invent how
to bend full hard stainless steel or have mega 9,000 ton castings or the largest hot
stamping in the world or new high-voltage, low-voltage architectures. It's learning
from everything we have done. So we hope we ramp faster than the technology --
(Multiple Speakers)
We also not do like (inaudible)
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Significantly less part. So yes, you all need to (Technical Difficulty) less of this. I mean,
you could probably be best in.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, exactly.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I mean, that side is still pretty revolutionary in how we are going to end up with. The
manufacturing approach for high volumes, more vehicle is revolutionary (inaudible)
revolutionary quite in the same way as the Cybertruck. I think it will be quite a fast
ramp. So as long as you're saying, we're doing everything possible to simplify that
vehicle in order to achieve a units per minute level that is unheard of in the auto
industry.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Yes. I mean, the simplification makes it easier to automate. It also makes it lower cost.
It's intrinsically lower cost.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Let's be clear, it'll be cool, but it's utilitarian. It's not meant to be, fill you with
Owen Magic, it can get you from A to B. It'll be so beautiful, but it's utilitarian. It's
Page 10 of 21

utility.
A - Unidentified Speaker
That's not 14 inches of travel under suspension.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, as an example. Yes. So I mean, the Cybertruck has a lot of bells and whistles.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
All right. Thank you very much. Let's go to Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
Hey, can you hear me fine?
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Yes, yes.
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
Hey, I have first like a follow-up question on FSD, and pricing, and adoption. So I
agree with you that as FSD improves, we should see its value increasing. But I guess
like the ultimate values of FSD, which is to be able to handle like the robotaxi, is not
going to necessarily interest everybody. And you have a bit of a degraded version
that would be like a chauffeur service where the car drives by itself, but you still have
to be in the car and around. And then there is like the hands on eyes on version of
the service. And I guess, there should be like much lower costs, lower feature kind of
variance of the service that could have a very large penetration on your install base
and more expensive one that would remain at a lower penetration level. So I'm just
wondering if you're taking that bit.
And last but not least, like the simplest version of FSD are available and are going to
work from a technical perspective probably before like the ultimate robotaxi version
can work, if ever. And so, I'm wondering how you take that into account in how
you're thinking like the financial contribution of FSD over time and whether you
could evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increase adoption.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, a fully autonomous vehicle, I think here sort of the economics of a fully
autonomous vehicle are truly astounding in a positive way. When you look at
passenger vehicles today, they only get about 10 to 12 hours of usage per week.
That's -- if you drive an hour and a half a day on average, that's roughly 10 hours a
week out of 168 hours. And then there's also you're going to have parking and
insurance. You got to take care of the car, it's like there's a lot of overhead.
Page 11 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-18
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
So I mean, it's -- yes. It's like the economics of the system are just insanely positive. If
given that the car -- like all of the cars we're making and have made for a while, we
believe are capable of full autonomy. So then if you're able to say increase the utility
of that car by a factor of 5 which still only means that you -- it's being used, or maybe
50 hours a week out of 168. So you still notice -- you still assume -- you best still
assume it's less than a third of the hours of the week is doing something useful.
You've increased the value of that by 5, but it still costs the same. Like you have
something, then we're a hardware company with software margins.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
All right. Pierre, do you have a follow-up?
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
Yes, I'd have actually a follow-up on a different topic for you. They've had -- if that's
okay. It's about like your gross margin in the quarter. Could you give us a sense of,
like in how the gross margin evolved sequentially, how much was the impact of idle
cost? How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of production ramping at
Berlin and Austin? And then I saw, like, this massive jump in energy storage, very
strong, positive surprise. So if you can give us the background on that and tell us
how we should think about that gross margin going forward?
A - Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
Thanks for that question. So, in terms of -- you have a few different aspects of your
question. So if I just look at from Q3 perspective, obviously factory idle time had an
impact. It did impact by, I mean, I won't give you the exact percentage, but it had
decent impact for the quarter. And when you look at the other pieces which we are
trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping up pretty well, right?
And they actually contributed pretty well to the margin for this quarter. In fact, one of
the factories came pretty close to in terms of per-unit costs to where we are for one
of our other established factory, which is Fremont. So that was a positive in the
quarter.
And when it comes to energy margins, we have -- Megapack deployment was the
key driver there. And that product has done well. I mean, on the cost curve also,
we've been able to do a lot there. But I do want to caution that, Megapack
deployments are a bit lumpy. So, yes, we had a great quarter this period, but
depending upon where we are trying to deploy that product in different markets,
you would see periods where there would be downward pressure on deployment
because of us trying to get the product to that place where it's --

Yes, product in transit.

Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you very much. Let's go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Rod, feel
free to unmute yourself.
Q - Rod Lache {BIO 1528384 <GO>}
Thanks. Really nice to see the rate of vehicle cost improvement despite the
downtime that you took. You've taken now about $2,000 out of the average vehicle
cost over the past year. Can you give us maybe a sense of the rate of improvement
that you see from the changes that you alluded to, the factory changes you alluded
to? Is there a way maybe to convey the speed of improvement on your existing
product from here? And then related to that, can you share the timing of your next
gen -- the lower priced product that you talked about earlier this year?
A - Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
Yes. So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you
look at this. There are certain things which we control, and there are certain things
which we don't control. We get -- we expect that we'll get some benefits from our
cost reduction efforts, which are all underway. But on the other hand, we just finished
our factory upgrades late in Q3. Some of these factories are still in the early ramp
phase in Q4. We're still not up to where we want those factories to be, so they'll
impact in the near term.
Plus, like Elon mentioned, we're going to be ramping Cybertruck, which is going to
be another headwind, which we will be dealing with. On top of all that, there's
overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder
to predict precisely as to where we'll land. But yes, this is something which -- it's an
evolving thing which we're observing every day and reacting to it on a daily basis.
A - Unidentified Speaker
I would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not -- we are unflagging
in our pursuit of additional cost downs for 2024. We do have a good pipeline of
them and work on both the engineering side and the factory operation side, and our
intention is to like maintain or exceed the trend that you saw. We're trying as hard as
we possibly can.
Q - Rod Lache {BIO 1528384 <GO>}
The timing of the next gen product, can you share that?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Not at this time.

Q - Rod Lache {BIO 1528384 <GO>}
Okay. And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that's
obviously not happening in a vacuum. And you mentioned that -- I think you
mentioned that at some point during this call that you're also maybe hitting the law
of large numbers on some of your products. Can you just share how you're thinking
about price elasticity, just at this point and in this macroenvironment, and any
thoughts along those lines?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think that there's very significant price elasticity. I mean, to be totally frank, if a car
cost the same as a RAV4, nobody would buy a RAV4 or at least they are very unlikely
to. It's worth noting that a lot of these incentives, like the -- their tax credit and
whatnot. But they're actually very difficult for the average person to access, because
they -- most people do not have $10,000, or even $7,500, burning a hole in their
bank account. A lot of (cid:0) a large number of people are living paycheck to paycheck,
and with a lot of debt, they have got credit card debt, mortgage debt.
So yes, it's -- that's reality for most people. It's sometimes difficult for people who are
high income members, and I'd say high, it'd be like someone who's earning over
$200,000 a year to understand what life is like for someone who is earning $50,000
or $60,000 or $70,000 a year, which is most people. So for a lot of people like these
tax credits, they can't front $7,500 for 18 months or even six months, to get for the tax
credit. And they actually don't, it's okay, so even have that $7,500 of taxes. So it's
really just the best regard to people is how much money do they have to pay
immediately and how much per month. That's it. And you can stop right there. And a
car is still much more expensive than RAV4 when you look at it that way.
A - Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
Yes. One other thing which I'll add, when you look at car buying in general, we're
trying to get to the next set of EV adapters.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
They're not an EV adapter, just who wants a great car.
A - Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
Exactly.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's not a -- sometimes you get these, like -- no, honestly, I would say it's like,
somewhat correlates with the why doesn't everyone work from home crowd? I'm
like, I mean, this is like some real Marie Antoinette vibes from people that say, why
doesn(cid:0)t everyone work from home? Like, what about all the people that have to
come to the factory and fill the cars? What about all the people that have to go to
the restaurant and make your food and deliver your food. It's like, what are you
talking about? You -- I mean, how detached from reality is the work-from-home
Page 14 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-18
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
crowd have to be? While they take advantage of all those who do, you cannot work-
from-home. So I mean, you have to say, like, why did I sleep in the factory so many
times? Because it mattered. So I just can't emphasize how important cost is. It's not
an optional thing for most people. It is a necessary thing.
We have to make our cars more affordable. The people can buy it and I keep
harping on this interest thing, but I mean, it's just raises the cost of the car. I mean,
we're looking at an internal analysis, which. I know we feel like we think is more or
less on track that when you look at the cost or the price reductions we've made in,
say, the Model Y, and you compare that to how much people's monthly payment has
risen due to interest rates, the price of the Model Y is almost unchanged.
A - Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
If you factor in the change in interest rates.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, which is what I'm trying to say. The thing that matters is the monthly pay -- it's
how much money do they have to put down, and do they literally have that in their
bank account, or will the check bounce? And then, what is the monthly payment?
And it doesn't matter how -- if that monthly payment is principal, interest, or
whatever, it's just a number, and that number has to not cause their bank account to
go negative. As it -- so going from near zero interest rates to kind of the current very
high interest rates, the actual monthly payment is basically the same, it's just a bunch
more of it is going to interest. And there's some incremental challenges beyond that,
which is the difficulty of getting credit at all has increased. And so the number of
people who simply cannot get credit, period. Even if they've got a job and
everything's solid, the banks are a little gun-shy on handing out credit, given that a
bunch of them kicked the bucket earlier this year.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, there's also just fewer options. Even if they plan to hand out credit, there's fewer
banks to go there.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's like, does your bank still exist? Well, if your bank does not exist, you have to
establish a relationship with a new bank. And so a lot of regional banks are died, and
I mean, even Credit Suisse. I mean, geez, that's -- that was a shocker. You've got a
160-year-old-ish Swiss institution that doesn't exist anymore. That's mind blowing.
And I think there's still quite a few shoes to drop on the bad credit situation.
Commercial real estate obviously is in terrible shape. Credit card debt has been
rising significantly. The credit card interest rates are usurious, over 20% interest rates,
meaning like, which over time is just -- becomes extremely punishing. If someone is
paying 20% interest on their credit card, it means they cannot pay them off. And if
you cannot pay them off, and you're still accruing interest at 20%, that's headed to a
bad place.

A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. And let's go to the next question from George from Canaccord.
Q - George Gianarikas {BIO 19376739 <GO>}
Thank you for taking my question. Just to focus on the cost per vehicle, coming
down in future quarters as you discussed in your written remarks. I'm curious as to
what the levers of that could be. Is it more scale, more factory utilization? Is it
material cost reductions? Are there things like giga casting? I mean, can you just kind
of give us some data points to give us confidence that that's going to come down
over time?
And if I can sneak one in, please, there are press reports, and I know how perilous it
is to believe some of these, but they say that you've included RADAR as an option in
some Model Ys in China. And I'm just here to ask you if that's true, and if so, why?
Thank you.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We've not included RADAR. We have RADAR as a Tesla-designed RADAR is an
experiment in the Model S and X. That's it. We'll see whether that experiment is
worth it. But there are no plans to integrate RADAR into 3 and Y. Just as humans
drive well, and in fact, an excellent human driver can drive with amazing safety
simply with their eyes, the car will far exceed the average human's safety just with
vision. Far, far, far.
Because -- I mean, the car is looking in all directions at once, and we don't have eyes
in the back of my head. So -- and the computer never gets tired, it never gets
distracted, get drunk, hopefully. And so, RADAR is -- what really matters is how much
does it affect the probability of an accident. And in order for the RADAR to be
effective, you have to be able to do RADAR-only braking, or you have to do actions
that are RADAR-only. Otherwise, you get this disambiguation problem between
vision and RADAR. That's why we actually turned off the RADAR in cars historically
that we had shipped. All 3 and Y used to have RADAR, but we turned it off, because
the RADAR actually generated more noise than signal.
Now the Tesla-designed RADAR is a high-resolution RADAR, that has some potential
to be useful, but the jury is still very much out on whether that is, in fact, the case.
A - Unidentified Speaker
On the cost question, I guess, from the vehicle side, like, as Drew mentioned earlier,
we are always trying to engineer our products to be cheaper to make and more
efficient to make. That comes, obviously, on the engineering side as we come up
with new innovations, but as well on the supply chain side with our partners, we work
with them to automate some of their lines, remove their bottlenecks and their high
costs as well. On the logistics side, getting parts to the factory. It's not like a one
thing that -- you have to attack cost everywhere. And we do it ruthlessly at all times.
Page 16 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-18
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
-- operations efficiencies all of the above.
A - Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, I would say there's a whole laundry list of things which we are chasing.
We internally call it the cost attack, where we're literally going line by line and saying,
how can we make it better? And it's a grind.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
A grind.
A - Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
It's a game of pennies.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's a game of pennies. It's like Game of Thrones, but pennies. I mean, first
approximation, if you've got a $40,000 car and roughly 10,000 items in that car, that
means each thing on average costs $4. So in order to get the cost down say by 10%,
you have to get $0.40 out of each part on average. It is a game of pennies.
A - Unidentified Speaker
We play it willingly.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. We've done it many, many times. And even something as simple as like a sticker,
like there's too many stickers internally in the car that nobody ever sees. There's
something as simple as a QR code. You might think, well, putting a QR code on part
one and just put them on there. It's like, well, are we actually going to use that QR
code.
A - Unidentified Speaker
That's a penny.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Exactly. And then, inevitably, some anti, QR code doesn't go on properly or you
can't read it properly and it stops the line.
A - Unidentified Speaker
It's worth more than a penny.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely.

A - Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
So --
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's chipping away with -- I mean, it is trying to, it is -- it does feel like digging a tunnel
with a spoon at times.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Very much escaping prison.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go
up, that would also bring some savings from higher production. But then on the flip
side, we're going to be ramping a new product, like Cybertruck, which we talked
about. So yes, so those are the real puts and takes, which we are working for.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. But there's not like some accidentally some gold -- brick of gold that we've left
in the car, unfortunately. And it's -- we're trying to be very rigorous about improving
the quality and capability of the car, because, it's like any fool can reduce the cost of
a car by making it worse, and just deleting functionality and capability. And that's
how I called sort of any fool -- if you want to like lose weight and you said, well, I
need to lose 15 pounds right away, well, you can chop your arm off, but then you're
sitting there with one arm, right? And you're still fat.
So it's sort of like, yes, you actually have to eat less food and work out. That's the
actual way and doctor's advice. Yes, super fun, because food is delicious. And I
personally, I'm not a huge -- I don't love working out. I know some people do, I wish I
could, but I don't. Unless moving the mouse consists of working out, in which case I
love moving the mouse.

Q - Colin Langan {BIO 15908877 <GO>}
Great, thanks for taking my question. You said in the commentary that you're not
going full tilt on the plant in Mexico until there's signs that the economy is strong.
Can you continue at a 50% CAGR without that plant? And where would that come
from? And any color on what you mean, sort of not going full tilt? Could that plant
get delayed indefinitely? Or what are you kind of talking about?
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
No, we're definitely making the factory in Mexico. We feel very good about that. We
put a lot of effort into looking at different locations and we feel very good about that
location. And we are going to build a factory there and it's going to be great. The
question is really just one of timing, and yes, it's going to be a broken record on the
interest front is just the interest rates have to come down. Like, if interest rates keep
rising, you just fundamentally reduce affordability.
It is just the same as increasing the price of the car. So I just don't have visibility into
it. If you can tell me what the interest rates are, I can tell you when we should build
the factory. We're going to build it. And I mean, I think we'll start the initial phases of
construction next year. But I am still somewhat scarred by 2009 when General
Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt. So well, that's now 14 years ago. It's -- that is
seared into my mind with a branding iron. Because Tesla was just hanging on by a
thread during that entire time. And I mean, we closed off a financing round in 2008
at 6 p.m., December 24th, Christmas Eve. And if we had not closed that financing
round, we would have bounced payroll two days after Christmas. So we actually
closed that round on the last hour of the last day that it was possible. Stressful, to say
the least. And then barely made it through 2009.
So I'm like, I want to just -- I don't want to be going at top speed into uncertainty. A
lot of wars going on in the world, obviously, as well. So -- and we have room here,
like, in Texas, you said we still have room in this building. It's not full with Cybertruck
and the why and there's plenty of growth opportunities still to have inside the
building where our team already is. We also have 2,000 acres here.
A - Unidentified Speaker
There's also a (inaudible)
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We're actually only occupying a tiny corner of the land that we are. But we could --
maybe technically do all the scaling just here. So I mean, personnel is our biggest
challenge and that the Greater Austin area only has -- generously the Greater Austin
area only has 2 million people. So people are moving here and they're willing to
move here, but there is somewhat of a housing crisis. They got to live somewhere.
So yes. So I don't know. I mean, I'm just curious. Like, I just -- I'm not saying things will
be bad. I'm just saying they might be. And I think, like, Tesla is an incredibly capable
ship, but it is, but if -- we need to make sure like as if the macroeconomic conditions
Page 19 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-18
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
are stormy, even if the best ship is still going to have tough times, the weaker ships
will sink. We're not going to sink, but even a great ship in a storm has challenges.
Now that storm will apply to everyone, not just us. And not just the auto industry, but
apply to everyone, I think. So apart from necessary sort of staples, like food and stuff,
but -- so I don't know. If interest rates start coming down, we will accelerate.
A - Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
All right.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
If anybody's got any guesses on this, I'd love to be less wrong. And I apologize if I'm
perhaps more paranoid than I should be. Because that might also be the case.
Because I have PTSD from 2009, big time. And in 2017 through '19 were not a picnic
either. That was very, very tough going. So the auto industry is also somewhat cyclic.
Because people tend to hesitate to buy a new car if there's uncertainty in the
economy. So car companies do very well in good economic times and they have --
do good as well in tough economic times. So it's -- whereas if somebody is selling
bread, then I think people still eat half bread. Yes, you need bread, you need food all
the time, but new car, you don't have to have (inaudible).
A - Vaibhav Taneja {BIO 20985733 <GO>}
Especially if you have wars going on, and then that impacts your sentiment.
A - Elon R. Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, if people are reading about wars all over the world, like this -- buying a
new car tends to not be front of mind.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
All right. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have today. Thank you very much for all
of your good questions, and we'll see you again in three months. Thank you very
