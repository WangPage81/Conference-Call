Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Tesla Motors Fourth Quarter 2013
financial results Q&A call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later,
we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that
time. I would now like to turn the call over to your host. Jeff Evanson, please go
ahead.
Jeff Evanson {BIO 17513488 <GO>}
Thank you, Patrick. Good afternoon, everyone; and welcome to our Fourth Quarter
financial results Q&A webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Tesla's Chairman and
CEO, and Deepak Ahuja, Tesla's Chief Financial Officer.
We announced the financial results of our Fourth Quarter and full-year 2013 results
shortly after the close of trading today. The shareholder letter, financial results and

webcast of this Q&A session are all available at our Investor Relations website, at
ir.teslamotors.com. A replay of this webcast will be available at the same site later
today.
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on the call, such as revenue
and income, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude
the effect of lease accounting on Model S sales and charges related to stock option
compensation. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP
measures can be found in our earnings release.
During the course of this call, we may discuss our business outlook and make
forward-looking statements. Such statements are predictions based on
management's expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ
materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in
our most recent SEC filings.
We'd ask you all to log in now for questions. So please press star-one on your
phones. And with that, Patrick, let's turn it over to the first question.
Actually, before we do that, I do want to say, if you could please limit your questions
to one question and one follow-up, we do want to try to end this call in about 45
minutes. All right, Patrick, let's have the first question, please.
Questions And Answers
Operator
Our first question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Q - Adam Jonas {BIO 3339456 <GO>}
All right. Thanks, everybody. Elon, the stock price and results have been obviously
performing very well lately.
You've got some great investment opportunities and some growth opportunities
ahead of you, not only in the auto business, but also in the non-auto business == in
the battery business. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about being
opportunistic and pulling in some fresh capital to help derisk the plan, plan for a
force majeur, or to see some of these opportunities that you have. Thank you.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I think that's a good idea. I would agree with that. I think that would be the smart
move.
We can talk more about that next week with -- and also discuss the giga factory
plans. Unfortunately, I can't say anything right now --

Q - Adam Jonas {BIO 3339456 <GO>}
As a follow-up to that --
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
-- except that I think your advice is good.
Q - Adam Jonas {BIO 3339456 <GO>}
Okay. I don't want to (inaudible) here or anything, but as a follow-up to that, I guess,
is would a capital raising be a prerequisite to launch the giga factory? Or is that an
understatement?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think it's necessary to have it occur in three years. It's not necessary, if we allow that
time frame to expand.
Q - Adam Jonas {BIO 3339456 <GO>}
That's very clear. Thanks, Elon.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
All right. You're welcome.
A - Jeff Evanson {BIO 17513488 <GO>}
Thanks, Adam. Next question.

Next question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line
is open.
Q - John Lovallo {BIO 22386768 <GO>}
Hello, guys. Thanks very much for taking the call.
First question would be, Deepak, just on your outlook for free cash flow in 2014 and
maybe in 2015, given the requisite investment that's going to go into the business.
How are you guys thinking about that?
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
I think in 2014 we certainly expect to generate significant cash flow from operations.
And our CapEx then which then feeds into free cash flow will depend quite a bit how
we continue to expand and what opportunities we see globally throughout the rest
of the year. So it's a bit early for me to call and give you clear guidance for certainly
Page 3 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
2015 and potentially all of 2014, but we certainly see this as really a great year for
growth, as we look forward.
Q - John Lovallo {BIO 22386768 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful.
If I could just follow up with you, Deepak, just thinking longer term, what do you
think is an achievable kind of mid-term or long-term EBIT margin? Taking gross
margin aside, how are you thinking about just from an operating profit, longer term?
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
I think we have in the past, even since the time of our IPO, indicated that our long-
term target is to get to an operating margin which is in the teens -- low to mid-teens.
And I think that is still what our long-term goal is, to get there, as we continue to
grow the business.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. And we should emphasize that we expect the reinvestment opportunities to be
very significant for a long time. So our actual profitability will be quite a bit less than
that.
Q - John Lovallo {BIO 22386768 <GO>}
Right.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
But if we were to sort of level out the business at any given point, I think something
like the mid-teens type of number is very achievable.
Q - John Lovallo {BIO 22386768 <GO>}
Exactly.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
And that's how we've always communicated.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Right. Right.
Q - John Lovallo {BIO 22386768 <GO>}
Okay, guys. Thank you.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}

I mean, the car business is truly staggeringly big. It's over $2 trillion a year in new car
sales. That's just new car sales. That's not even taking into account servicing and
used car sales and accessories and all the other things. So there's just a pretty big
ramp ahead in terms of reinvestment.
Q - John Lovallo {BIO 22386768 <GO>}
Got it. That's helpful. I'm going to try to sneak one more in here. Jeff, I apologize.
But in terms of distribution licenses in China, from what we understand, they're
pretty difficult to obtain, particularly without a local partner. How are you guys able
to deal with this issue?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Actually, sales and service is not a problem in China. It's more local manufacturing,
where there's an expectation that you partner with a local entity. And since we're
really just at the early stages of -- very early stages of selling cars in China, and we're
very far away from -- very far by Tesla's time frame standards -- away from
manufacturing in China. But we do expect that in the long term -- at least for the
short to medium term, there's not a need for a local partner.
Q - John Lovallo {BIO 22386768 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you very much, guys.
A - Jeff Evanson {BIO 17513488 <GO>}
All right, John. Patrick, let's have the next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open.
Q - Brian Johnson {BIO 7256455 <GO>}
Yes. Good afternoon. Just want to look at the line of what you used to call
reservations and now you call customer deposits, went from 140 to 163, last year 138
and they've been churning in the 130s.
Can we infer from that -- should we be inferring a unit order uptake? Or is it more
mix of the reservations and the currencies and the products that people put down
there to make orders -- deposits, not reservations -- for?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think the biggest thing we can attribute that sort of growth to is that the Model X
demand is very high. The number of -- obviously, we don't disclose that. But even
though there's zero marketing for the Model X, essentially, if you were going fishing,
it's like the fish are jumping in the boat. We're not actually trying to sell the Model X
Page 5 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
at all, but the demand seems to be remarkably high; and we're seeing a steady
accumulation of Model X deposits.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Which is on top of our ongoing Model S deposits coming, so that draws the overall
part.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
Q - Brian Johnson {BIO 7256455 <GO>}
So if you look at your new guide for 35K units for 2014 and shared the comment a
fair chunk of that will be in China and Europe. Just where it is, just directionally
where does the order book stand in those geographies? What's trending better than
you might have expected, and where do you still need some marketing or education
work?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well I think there's probably work to do in a number of locations in Europe. Mostly
because we still have to sort out a number of charging issues. Because even though
the EU is sort of one market economically, it's certainly not one market from an
electricity standpoint. So we're sorting through a number of charging issues over
there.
And I think that's slowing down our (inaudible) in Europe temporarily. But I feel
confident about addressing those very near-term. And I expect that sales will pick up
quite a bit over in Europe.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
At the same time, we see very good demand in China and in the emerging (vie) and
drive markets.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely. Yes, I mean, it's -- based on current trends, it seems unlikely that we'll
be able to satisfy demand in China this year. So there will be unmet-- likely to be, I
think, unmet demand in China this year.
Q - Brian Johnson {BIO 7256455 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Page 6 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Q - Ryan Brinkman {BIO 16417954 <GO>}
Hello. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Thanks.
Q - Ryan Brinkman {BIO 16417954 <GO>}
I see that you're guiding to strong 28% gross margins by 4Q this year. Can you talk
about some of the drivers of that margin expansion? Is it is more leverage of fixed
COGS than higher revenue, or is it still the case that you're realizing significant
supplier purchase price reductions as your volume ramps?
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Yes. It's all of that. We are also continuing to make design improvements for the
product, which is also helping us. And clearly, as we expand production, our
suppliers see economies of scale and so do we.
In addition, there is efficiency, as we continue to stabilize and mature our production
processes. So all of that, we feel, is a contributor to getting to that gross margin
improvement.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's not a huge difference from 25 to 28, and I think we can arguably achieve that just
by scaling up. So in fact, the 28 number is assuming that the take rate of options
decreases slightly. So we're not planning on lowering the price of the car.
But as we reach the broader market, the option uptake, for example, people
ordering, say, performance-plus, we expect will decrease. And there will be more
orders of the more affordable version of the car. So the 28% is assuming a lower
average price because of lower option take.
Q - Ryan Brinkman {BIO 16417954 <GO>}
Great. Thanks. Then just last question in China.
There's been a lot of talk of government incentives there to spur clean vehicle sales
to try to improve the air quality. Have you been able to determine whether or not
Tesla can be eligible for these types of subsidies?
Then separate to that, I'm just curious what kind of volume assumptions do you have
in China baked into that 35,000 delivery number? And what do you think China
could do for you, over time?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Page 7 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
I don't think we want to break out the exact market percentages. And I think it's
difficult for us to estimate them with precision. Except that it appears that based on
demand, since we announced pricing in China, that it seems unlikely that we'll be
able to get everyone a car this year.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
And in terms of the incentives, we are talking to the authorities and we're working to
see how the Model S can be included. Clearly, the initial round was -- or the
expectation was this only applies to local manufacturers. But that is something we're
working to include Model S in that list.
Q - Ryan Brinkman {BIO 16417954 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Thanks. Congrats again on the quarter.
Operator
Our next question comes from Andrea James with Dougherty and Company. Your
line is open.
Q - Andrea James {BIO 6843557 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my two questions. Regarding the giga factory, are you guys
prepared to say you've secured a partner yet? And can you give us a sense of what
you mean by "major reduction" intact costs?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well we actually expect there to be more than one partner in the factory. Obviously,
Panasonic is currently our primary partner on cell production. And so a default
assumption would be that Panasonic would continue to partner with us in the giga
factory.
But there are also likely to be other suppliers in the factory that provide the
precursor materials to the cell. So the anode and cathode materials, separator,
electrolyte, that kind of thing. But I don't want talk too much about the giga factory,
because we're going to talk about that next week and there's a lot of stuff to talk
about, besides that, in this earnings release. Yes, so I think that we'll have to just to
punt that answer and detail to next week.
Q - Andrea James {BIO 6843557 <GO>}
Okay. Fair enough. Then the next question, obviously, customer deposits are up 16%,
so demand looks good. But I think it would be helpful if you could address the effect
on demand that was caused by the vehicle fires last fall and the subsequent media
firestorm regarding all that.
Then, is it measurable? What did you see?
Page 8 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. So at first, we saw a significant drop in demand. And we were quite worried
about it.
Then, as consumers came to understand that this was really kind of a media-driven
thing and not a real danger with the car, our sales improved steadily since then. And
have continued to improve since that initial news. Basically, consumers have come to
understand that actually our car has a far lower propensity for fire than a gasoline
car, and by reason of a half order of magnitude.
And so, yes, as consumers became aware of that, their fears have subsided. I think
it's great that we live in an era where there's the internet and social media. So that
when something is -- when the fans are flamed, literally, by the media, there is at
least a path for consumers to understand what is really going on. I think in the
absence of social media, I'm not sure we would have been able to correct the
misperception.
Q - Andrea James {BIO 6843557 <GO>}
Do you need the NHTSA report then to come out then, or do you think it will have no
effect when it does? I'm assuming it will clear the car completely.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We anticipate a positive result. And I think it will certainly help some number of
people out there.
And it's worth noting that we've been cleared by the regulatory agencies in every
other country, so Germany, Britain, Japan, China, everyone else. So it's actually just
the US regulatory authorities are the lone holdout, at this point. But we've provided
NHTSA with all the information that they've requested, and we're awaiting a decision
from them, which hopefully would come soon. And yes, probably helpful to some
number of consumers out there.
Q - Andrea James {BIO 6843557 <GO>}
Thank you, so much.
Operator
Our next question comes from Elaine Kwei with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Q - Elaine Kwei {BIO 16515027 <GO>}
Yes, hello. Thanks for taking my question.
First, on the production guidance for ending the year at 1,000-car-a-week rate. That
sounds like it's two lines going full-time at roughly a 20,000-a-year type of rate, and
Page 9 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
a pretty good step-up from, I think, some of the previous guidance. Could you help
shed some light on what's getting you there? And is that pretty much where you'd
be maxing out?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So we are constructing a new line in the factory. So it's a little -- the full answer is a
little complex, because there are many pieces that go into making a Model S, some
of which are production constrained and some of which are not. So to get to the sort
of height, the sort of 1,000-plus production rate, we do need a sort of a new final
assembly line, which we're in the process of constructing. Then we'll transition the
final assembly to that, hopefully around the end of the Third Quarter, or thereabouts.
Then there's sort of separately a body construction line, which is where you create
the body and welded assembly, welded and bonded assembly, that's also taking
place. That's not needed to achieve the production rate, but will help with
production efficiency. And will also be where the Model X is built. It will be a sort of a
next-generation body assembly facility for the X, and then the S. So I'm not sure -- it's
quite -- it would be quite a long answer to give you the full story, but that's -- maybe
those are the highlights.
Q - Elaine Kwei {BIO 16515027 <GO>}
Sure. That's really helpful.
And with that 1,000-a-week with the new final assembly line, is that, with that I
assume that's not with that maxed out? And that's sort of using part of the capacity,
and then there would be additional capacity beyond that, once the construction is
completed. Would that be fair to assume?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's fair to assume that we would be able to go to higher numbers, if the demand is
there to -- yes, yes.
Q - Elaine Kwei {BIO 16515027 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you very much, Elon.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
All right.

Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Q - Ben Kallo {BIO 16897436 <GO>}
Hello, Elon. Hello, Deepak. Hello, Jeff.
Page 10 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Just building on Elaine's question, you said if demand's there, can you just talk about
the evolution of what you see in demand if you look back a year ago and where you
think it could be two years from now, in 2016, just for the S? Then if you could loop
that in with your production expansion and where that could get you with the two
different factors that you mentioned to answer Elaine 's question?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's difficult to predict where the demand really settles out with the S. But I can say, in
relative terms, it appears that the X will see at least as much demand as the S. And if I
was to guess -- I mean, it's just a guess -- I think the X demand may exceed the S
demand.
This is very speculative. Don't hold me to it. But that's my best guess. I think X
demand will exceed S demand.
And as far as S demand, of course, there are a lot of factors here, because it's not just
demand for the S, but let's say the world were to go into a recession in 2016. It's
difficult to say what the gas demand, how would we be affected and that kind of
thing. So then you start to encounter macro factors.
But it seems like -- it seems pretty likely that we could sustain demand of around
1,000 units a week. That's my best guess for the S.
Q - Ben Kallo {BIO 16897436 <GO>}
Okay. Great. And I'm going to ask on the giga factory, try my best here.
You talked about partners, really supply partners. Should we expect also, I guess
people that would use the cells, so customer off-takes or partners in that aspect of
people that would use lithium ion batteries, in the announcement?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. It's tempting to get into the giga factory stuff. But I could have the whole call
talking about that, and we're going to have more of a dedicated call next week to
talk about it. But I think that the giga factory would absorb all of the sales produced
and that we would probably even need to bring in cells from other factories from
around the world.
Q - Ben Kallo {BIO 16897436 <GO>}
Okay. Fair enough. Then, just housekeeping for Deepak.
Q1, as we flex it, we're right on the verge of profitability. How should we think about
that and your guys' goal for Q1?
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Sorry, could you clarify that further?
Page 11 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Q - Ben Kallo {BIO 16897436 <GO>}
If I flex the numbers in Q1 and what you said operating expenses and then your
deliveries, I can be on the verge of being profitable or not profitable. So how are you
guys leaning in that aspect as we model Q1?
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
I see. We definitely should be profitable on a non-GAAP basis, even in Q1.
Q - Ben Kallo {BIO 16897436 <GO>}
Great. Thank you very much, guys. Great quarter.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I do want to emphasize something that, it would be -- we could have tried to aim for
a higher delivery number in Q1. If we were to kind of gain deliveries and not try to
sort of be a bit of a contortionist and enter the vehicles in transit. But I made a
decision that we shouldn't try to do that, and we should just try to produce cars in
the right way for the various markets.
And so our actual revenue number for Q1 is going to be less than it would be if we
did try to play all sorts of games with delivery, delivery between domestic and
international markets. So I think that it's the right decision for the long term, but it
means that our Q1 actual recognized revenue will be lower than it might otherwise
be.
A - Jeff Evanson {BIO 17513488 <GO>}
Patrick, we're ready for the next question.

The next question comes from Dan Galves with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Q - Dan Galves {BIO 16540648 <GO>}
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions.
Just thinking about your comment on 1,000 per week Model S's, and putting that
together with your comment that Europe and Asia could be about double the US
deliveries by Q4 this year. I guess if you think about 12,000 units like something
approximately for Q4, four, four and four between the three markets, is that where
you're seeing US demand now? Is that where you think it will settle out? Or is that
basically trying to kind of balance getting vehicles to each region?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Page 12 of 21
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yes, I sort of answered this question earlier. It's very difficult to predict with precision
the exact division of sales.
Actually, the best fidelity that we can forecast right now is really that we think non-
North American sales will be about twice the size of American sales, roughly
speaking. This is not to say it will be exactly twice the size, but it's roughly. And -- yes
-- yes.
Q - Dan Galves {BIO 16540648 <GO>}
Okay.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
And I mean, something we try to do is to try to balance customer wait times.
Because, for example, like last quarter, we actually did quite a few European
deliveries, because customers in Europe had been waiting for a really long time to
receive their car. And so we just had to balance that with slowing down US deliveries
and try to make people as happy as possible, given the production constraints.
Q - Dan Galves {BIO 16540648 <GO>}
I imagine that's a difficult task. The second question is related to China charging.
What's your view on -- in the US, most people are just charging at their home.
Is that a viable option, based on where Chinese consumers are living? What is an
option for a Chinese consumer that may live in an apartment building, and how
much work have you guys done on that?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We're working pretty hard on that and we believe we've got some good solutions.
We're going to talk more about that in the coming months.
Q - Dan Galves {BIO 16540648 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We're going to make sure that that's not a limitation.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Q - Patrick Archambault {BIO 4638109 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. Just a couple from me, maybe starting with OpEx.
Deepak, you said that OpEx is, I believe, up 15% Q1, and I think increasing thereafter,
based on the investments. And can we put some parameters around that? Is there
still, as we think about, operating profit, is there still some leverage, some ability to
leverage OpEx? Or is investment costs next year really kind of offsetting this -- this
fixed cost component for now?
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
We're very mindful of OpEx. We continue with our culture of being frugal, but
investing where it makes sense for the business. So I think it's a bit early or
premature for me to give you sort of longer-term guidance beyond Q1. But our
approach really is to be focused in the most cost efficient manner to achieve our
growth.
And also trying, over time, bring our percentage -- our OpEx percentage of revenue
down and contribute to the bottom line. So I think that's the longer-term trend that
you will continue to see.
Q - Patrick Archambault {BIO 4638109 <GO>}
Okay. Just, I guess, one quick housekeeping one for me. I don't know if I missed it,
but did you give the US/international split on the 6,829 Fourth Quarter and 22,000
and change for the full year, in terms of deliveries?
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
No. We didn't provide that. We haven't done that in the past. And we have -- for
Europe, more than -- I think -- I would just put it this way, most of the growth that
came in Q4 is from Europe, though US and North America continued at the same
pace as Q3. I think that's the more relevant information.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Q3 to Q4, US deliveries were very similar, but the increment went to Europe.
Q - Patrick Archambault {BIO 4638109 <GO>}
Can I squeeze one last one in? It sounds like your expectations for the X are perhaps
higher than many of us had thought. How can we, from a profitability standpoint,
how can we think about the accretion of that platform?
It sounds like the volume's going to be pretty high. You're leveraging infrastructure
that's in already. Presumably, there's things you've learned in the manufacturing
process of the S that you can apply, and that your suppliers have learned, as well. So
how should we think about that as kind of a tailwind or impact on the overall mix?

A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I'm not sure I totally understand the question, but --
Q - Patrick Archambault {BIO 4638109 <GO>}
I can rephrase it. It's just that you're launching a new vehicle having garnered
considerable efficiencies and learnings through the process of the S. And
presumably also, your suppliers have done, as well. So in addition to just the
leverage, is there kind of a margin tailwind that you can expect just from launching
the X and having applied all the stuff that you've learned in the process of
developing the S?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay. So basically, do we expect gross margins to be higher with the X, and maybe
flowing back into the S, as well?
Q - Patrick Archambault {BIO 4638109 <GO>}
Yes. That would be -- and I'm not talking about just on a fixed cost. I'm talking more
on a variable cost basis, actually.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Right. You know, there could be. Although, as I said, we do expect the option take
rate to reduce, so that's why we're being, we're saying 28% gross margin. But if the
option take rate doesn't reduce, obviously it will be higher than that.
Q - Patrick Archambault {BIO 4638109 <GO>}
Okay. Then what about, like I know we're looking out to 2015 for when the X is going
to be -- well, in launch mode and have some volume on it. But from -- is there some
kind of mix tail wind to be garnered just from the launch of that product, just
applying, again, all of the efficiencies that you've learned and supply relationships.
And all those benefits that you've accrued through the launch process of the S?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I'm sure there will be efficiencies, yes. We don't want top predict something better
than a 28% gross margin, but I think there probably will be efficiencies. It seems
likely.
A - Jeff Evanson {BIO 17513488 <GO>}
All right. Pat, we've got to get on to the next question, please.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Thanks so much. Can you guys give us an update on the tack time that you're seeing
right now, and the transition towards running two full shifts? How do you see that
playing out, just in terms of hiring and how many people are you going to have to
add to do that?
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Colin, so just to clarify, we are running a two-shift operation in one of our factories.
And again, the factory is very complex, as Elon said, in different shops, run under
different operating patterns, and there is no single tack time, per se, that we can
share with you. Our focus is just to continue to improve efficiencies.
Then, through the significant ramp-up in the second half will come, as Elon
indicated, with the move to the new final assembly line and the body construction
line. So I think there are broader factors which help us get there. And tell me if I'm
answering your question satisfactorily?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
And you would need to add a ton of people to achieve the 1,000 car per week rate?
Is that what you're asking?
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
No. More what I'm thinking about is standardization and the leverage that you guys
are going to get off of the process improvement. It seems like you've done an awful
lot of prep work, in terms of setting a foundation for the process. and then are
making ongoing improvements to that and then potentially locking in processes that
then just basically speed up, and you're going to get more leverage out of that. So
that's what I'm trying to get after.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I think we'll be able to ramp our production rate quite a bit with a fairly small
increase in hiring. So yes. Our labor efficiency, essentially, is likely to improve a lot
over the course of this year.
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Okay. Great. I can take some of that off-line.
Can you just give us a bit of an update on the trend line for shipments into North
America from 3Q into 4Q and your expectation into the First Quarter?
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Yes, I think as going from Q4 to Q1 -- sorry, or is it from Q3 to Q4? Could you clarify
that?

Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
I'll have both, if you don't mind.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
I think Q4 to Q1, as we indicated in the shareholder letter, and as Elon mentioned, we
are ramping up even further into Europe and China. And we could have played
games and tried to shift the mix and delivered more cars in the US to hit a higher
delivery number in Q1. but we decided to smoothen the flow of cars in our
operational issues. And that's why you see the small reduction in Q1 deliveries and
the mix shift little bit more into Europe and Asia and from a production point of view.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I wouldn't try to read too much into it, essentially.
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Great. Appreciate it.

Our next question comes from (Agidi Sagari) with FBR Capital. Your line is open.
Q - Agidi Sagari
Thank you. My first question is on China.
So currently, China is pretty unique, first of its kind. Do you expect any kind of
competitive response in the market, and maybe if you could elaborate on how that
pricing is translating into demand for the vehicle?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well I mean, hopefully other manufacturers will adjust their pricing to not exploit
Chinese consumers. I think that's the right thing for them to do, and it's what they
ought to have been doing from the beginning. I don't know that they will do that,
but that's what they probably should do.
And we are seeing really strong demand, which hopefully will continue. But it's been
very strong since we announced pricing. And I think our bigger challenge will be
trying to satisfy that demand.
Q - Agidi Sagari
Got it. My second question was on the Model X. So if we think about the Model X
coming out with an improved power train, more capabilities, should we expect some
of those improvements to be translated into the Model S also, when that gets
launched?

A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Actually, I'd rather not comment too much on future Model S changes, except to say
that obviously, we add features to the vehicle all the time. With every month, there's
something that's been added or improved. It's sort of a continuously improved
vehicle.
Q - Agidi Sagari
All right. Thank you. That's all I had.
A - Jeff Evanson {BIO 17513488 <GO>}
Thanks.

The next question comes from James Albertine with Stifel. Your line is open.
Q - James Albertine {BIO 17420845 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the question and good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to get a
sense for -- really, a clarification first -- on the commentary you made with respect to
the construction you're undertaking at the facility in California. Will any of that
construction be leverageable for the third generation car, or is this primarily
dedicated to the X and S, at this point?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's dedicated to the S and X. So the third generation vehicle -- certainly, we'll learn
from those lines, but third generation vehicle will have a completely separate
production process.
Q - James Albertine {BIO 17420845 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you for that.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's geared to a higher volume -- so, yes.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
And the Fremont factory is big enough to accommodate --
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Absolutely. I should mention that we do anticipate being able to do the third
generation vehicle production in that Fremont facility. When it was owned by Toyota
and General Motors, it was able to produce half a million vehicles a year. And I feel
like we could get there with our vehicles, as well.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Q - James Albertine {BIO 17420845 <GO>}
Understood. Then sort of a related question or follow-up.
Over the course of the next three years, you've alluded to -- and I guess we'll hear
next week more about the giga factory. Obviously, that overlaps with what we had
understood the expectation for the third generation timeline. Is it fair to say there's
been a shift, or a reprioritization, above and beyond the third generation car that's,
again, more focused on the importance and relevance of the giga factory and its
contribution?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The giga factory is really there to support the volume of the third generation car. And
yes, that's really -- so it's happening in parallel with development of the third
generation car. And we want to have the vehicle engineering and tooling come to
fruition at the same time as the giga factory. And yes, so it's all really part of one
strategy, one combined effort.
Q - James Albertine {BIO 17420845 <GO>}
So there's no movement, in other words, on the expectation for a 2017 launch on that
third generation?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
No.
Q - James Albertine {BIO 17420845 <GO>}
Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks for taking the question. Good luck.
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
All right. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Craig Irwin with Wedbush Securities. Your line is
open.
Q - Craig Irwin {BIO 6209023 <GO>}
Most of the things that I wanted to ask have already been pretty thoroughly raked
through. But maybe, Elon, if you could clarify for us what you said, I think on the last
call, where you discussed a preference for battery manufacturing technology with a
significantly lower environmental footprint than what's conventionally used today.
Are you possibly referring to maybe some of the solvent-free manufacturing
approaches, or are you referring to some of the more advanced recovery systems?
Maybe could you clarify for us little bit what you're referring to and what you prefer,
as far as technology approach?

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. First of all, I don't think it's the case that current lithium ion production is
particularly bad, environmentally. But I think if you visit, say, the Panasonic cell
factories in Japan, they're super-clean, and they don't have terrible emissions or
waste or anything like that.
But I think we can also take it a step further with the giga factory and have a plant
that is heavily powered by renewables, wind and solar. And that has built into it the
recycling capability for all battery packs. So you can really look at the whole life cycle
of the battery pack and be in the best possible situation, from an environmental
standpoint.
And I should point out, also, though, that lithium ion battery packs are recycled
today. There's a recycling facility in Vancouver and one in Belgium, for US and
Europe. And they have quite a bit of value.
So it's not as though they are sent to a landfill, even as it is. But with the giga, factory
we'd like to combine the whole thing. Yes.
Q - Craig Irwin {BIO 6209023 <GO>}
Okay. Then one other clarification.
So your ASPs have been trending positive the last couple of quarters. You seem to
be conservative about the progression in 2014. Do you expect the sequential
increases in the ASPs to continue for the next couple quarters and then abate? Or
when you look at your current order book, are you seeing a flattening out of the
curve already?
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's definitely flattening out, in terms of the purchase price. Flattening out to, I'd say
maybe slightly reducing, but I mean it's -- I mean it's within like a cent or two.
But we do -- I mean, I do think -- it seems like the prudent thing is to assume that
there's a reduction in the option take rate as we get to more of a mainstream market
and fewer people take the high-performance options on the car, which generate
quite a bit of margin. So we're just trying to be conservative on this front, and maybe
that -- maybe the average selling price doesn't decline, but we want to protect for a
scenario where it does.
A - Jeff Evanson {BIO 17513488 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you very much, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We look forward
to seeing many of you in early March at the Barclays BNP Paribas Auto Conference in
Geneva or on any of our upcoming investor events. Have a great day.
