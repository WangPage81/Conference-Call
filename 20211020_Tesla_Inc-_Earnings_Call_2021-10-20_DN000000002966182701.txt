Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2021 Q&A webcast.
My name is Martin Viecha, Senior Director of Investor Relations and I'm joined today
by our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn; and our Senior VP Andrew Baglino as well as other
executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3:00 PM Central Time in the
update deck we published at the same link as this webcast
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking
statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of
today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one
question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question
queue. But before we jump into the Q&A, Zach has some opening remarks. Zach?

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yeah, thanks Martin. We are continuing to make great progress as a company, setting
new records on each of the most important financial metrics for Q3. Overall, we
delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter and 70% higher than
the same quarter last year. We were also able to achieve an annualized production
run rate of over 1 million cars towards the end of the quarter.
The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the
Model Y at our Shanghai factory. Additionally, we have made great progress
increasing production volumes of Model S and have recently started the ramp and
deliveries of Model X. It will take a bit more time to get this program back to higher
volumes, but based on demand we are targeting to exceed historical production
levels.
We have also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export
hub. This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and
to introduce Model Y to Europe. Due to part shortages and logistics variability we
have not been able to run our factories at full capacity. It's important to note that
while we have roughly doubled deliveries year to date, this has been exceptionally
difficult to achieve.
I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production
teams for showing impressive flexibility as we make adjustments real time. This
team's expertise in the chip industry across all Tiers has made a huge difference in
managing through these challenges. Additionally, we never reduced our production
forecast with our suppliers, as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible. I also
want to thank our suppliers for their dedication and partnership to Tesla. Despite
these increases in production and generally higher prices our backlogs are
continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending. The only
practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to
build more cars on our existing production lines which is where we are focused.
Similar dynamics are also playing out in our storage business as we are working to
expand Powerwall and Megapack production as quickly as parts and sells allow us to
do so. Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery
manufacturing program and we're excited to have expanded to Full Self Driving
beta program to more customers. Financially our Auto gross margins reached 30.5%
on a GAAP basis and just under 29% excluding regulatory credits, which is our
strongest yet. This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes, particularly out of
the Shanghai factory increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have made good
progress, increasing Model S volumes.
The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin and we expect this to
increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X. As was the case in Q2,
there were some net benefits from pricing actions. However, this remains small in the
context of other contributors. Please keep in mind that given backlog it will take time
for the impact of recent changes to flow through our financials. Note that we are also
not yet recognizing additional revenue from the FSD beta program. Supply chain

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
challenges, including (inaudible) continued to provide cost headwinds as was also
the case with FX this quarter.
While we are seeing an impact from the rising commodity and labor costs we have
also been adjusting pricing, which should help to compensate. Overall, as I
mentioned in our last call, our P&L continues to benefit from the marginal of
profitability of each incremental unit with higher fixed cost absorption. As a result of
the great progress on margins, volume, and appropriate management of overhead
costs we were able to achieve an operating margin of just under 15%, exceeding the
long-term guidance we've laid out previously.
On cash, we generated record operating cash flows of $3.1 billion and continued to
invest heavily in the build out of manufacturing supercharging and service capacity.
We also continued to retire high-interest rate debt including the early settlement of
our 2025 Senior Notes of 1.8 billion during the quarter. As we look forward, we are
clearly quite a bit ahead of the pacing required to achieve our target annual growth
rate of 50% this year. Q4 production will depend heavily on availability of parts. But
we are driving for continued growth.
We are also nearing assembly of our first production cars in Austin and Berlin. It's
important to stress, while the first production car is an important milestone the
hardest work lies ahead in the ramp. Please keep in mind that we are pushing the
boundaries on new product and manufacturing technologies at these factories,
which makes it difficult to predict the exact pace of the ramp.
These factories will also partially weigh on our margins as we work towards volume
production. Overall, I'm very proud of what the team has accomplished and I'm
excited for our next phase of growth into Q4 and into 2022. The team has done a
tremendous job improving our financial health in a short period of time, while also
continuing to preserve improve our precision and pace of execution. Thank you.
Questions And Answers
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much and we will now take questions from institutional and retail
shareholders that we posted on our website.
The first question is, when should we expect the first vehicles to be delivered with
4680 cells.
Q - Unidentified Participant
Yeah, thanks. Martin. Early next year from a non-cell perspective structural battery
crash range and reliability testing are on track to be complete this quarter testing to
date has gone well and the Fremont manufacturing line is on track to support.
However, similar to what Zach said before, this is a new architecture and unknowns
may exist still. Our top priority is ensuring quality in what we deliver. And from a cell
Page 3 of 20
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing
readiness matching the pack timeline I just mentioned.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. The second question from institutional investor comes, do you
still expect to start production of the $25,000 model in 2023. What are the biggest
hurdles from now until then.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Thanks, Martin. Yeah. We're working on a strategy to increase our production rates as
quickly as possible. I think Zach (inaudible) that well and we're doing this well to try
and add the least amount of incremental complexity to the business. We don't want
to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we're generally in a cell-constrained
world while there is still more runway to grow these existing products. We are
focused on Model Y expansion in Austin, Berlin, ramping S and X further in three
months to restore to past levels while also growing 3 and Y production in Fremont
and Shanghai. As we mentioned before after Model Y in Austin our next product
launch will be Cybertruck and that timing course depends on increasing cell capacity
both from our suppliers and through our inherent so as well as many other
headwinds we faced in supply chain and completing our currently full plate of
products on the table.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. The third question is with FSD beta training data set to
explode exponentially as software has released a wider and wider audience. Are
there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be
pushed out from biweekly to weekly or even daily.
A - Unidentified Speaker
At this point, it's not so much about how much data can we collect but how quickly
can we process the data we've collected. This is where Dojo comes in as we
mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster computer and Dojo will be able to
iterate more often than we do and[ph] say the training and that takes one day
instead of one week makes a huge difference in our ability to push out more
updates. But realistically, there's a whole lot more that comes into play when
iterating software updates. The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including
testing and validation needs to be set up for faster iteration to daily updates are not
really realistic for now.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. The next question is, can you provide an update on future
model development and how much diversity in your fleet will be necessary to
achieve 20 million in annual volumes. The best selling cars in the world today only
sell slightly over 1 million units. So is it possible to achieve 20 million units with just S,
X, 3, Y, truck and the $25,000 car?
Page 4 of 20
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Unidentified Speaker
Thanks, Martin. Yeah as we've mentioned before, we've seen record growth in both
Model 3 and Model Y segments where Model 3 is currently the best-selling luxury
sedan worldwide. And as we mentioned at our shareholders' meeting Model Y is
poised to be the best selling vehicle in the world. Tesla continues to break modes in
these Vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product as we've said
publicly will eventually expand the vehicle item to get to larger volumes and we
believe that we will need to be in all major segments across small, mid-size, large
sedans, SUVs and trucks to do so along with the course a massive space of
robotaxis[ph].
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. The next question from retail shareholder is what is Tesla's
goal for vehicle production capacity for the four current factories Fremont, Shanghai,
Austin and Berlin by 2024.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah. Thanks, Martin. Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average basis[ph]
50% per year and so you can extrapolate that out. There may be some periods of
time in which we're well ahead of that. There could be some periods of time despite
best efforts we are slightly lower than that, but that remains the long-term goal of the
company. In Fremont we're continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible
there. Over the last 12 months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production and
based upon everything that we know in the factory where the bottlenecks are what
the potential is we're targeting to increase that another 50%.
I think that will be a difficult goal, but that's the goal that the internal team has and
they're going to continue to push on that. As we look towards Shanghai we're
continuing to push the boundaries there and we continue to ramp production there
as well. So most recently the ramp up to Model Y, which was our biggest contributor
of volume in Q3 will continue to ramp that factory and in our plans there with time
are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
Austin and Berlin are interesting factors because our first iterations of capacity there
are on Model Y but we've intentionally set these factories and locations in which they
have a quite significant amount of land and ability to expand and so we'll take Model
Y at these factories. We're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can. And
then, we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per
week at those factories and then we'll add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to
grow from there.
So our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years and
then ultimately in the long-term be able to achieve 20 million cars per year. We're
going to grow as quickly as feasibly possible with an eye towards a 50% annual
growth rate.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Great, thank you very much. The next question is, what is your view on the tightening
regulatory environment for FSD, the investigation and broad data request by NHTSA
some of the recent nominees (inaudible) have been publicly critical of FSD including
engaging with short[ph] sellers online. How will you manage this environment?
A - Lars Moravy
Thanks, Martin. Yeah. As we have been for years. We always engage with and it's
another worldwide regulatory bodies to share our knowledge and to work with them
on our approaches on both active and passive safety. There are ongoing regulatory
inquiries taking place all the time and especially on the subjects like FSD they are at
the cutting edge of technology development. During these investigations my team,
myself are always cooperative as much as possible. We expect and embrace the
scrutiny of these products and know that the truth about their performance in the
innovations, our products have will ultimately be all that matters. In the end and as
I've said on previous calls, we take safety as a top priority in all our designs.
This is because our primary motivation is from -- coming from a team of incredible
engineers designing software and hardware that saves lives and prevent injuries and
doing so we will continue to be transparent to the public on how our technology is
both developing from an auto pilot safety data, the latest of which we just shared in
the Shareholder Update and you can also see in review a wide variety of customer
post FSD videos and social media.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Right, just to add to that, I mean as Lars said safety is extremely important for Tesla.
It's the right thing to do. And if you look at various independent testing and
regulatory testing of our products. You can see the work of incredibly talented
engineers and the results of those tests and our goal in developing safety-oriented
software around the car is to continue to go beyond what the hardware is able to
provide, if you can prevent a crash from happening that's the safest way to manage
this and I think at a macro level here, what we're seeing and this is entirely
understandable and expected is that the automotive industry is going through a
transition from the traditional car as we know it to more of a computer software
oriented sensor suites around them that can manage things beyond just what the
driver manages.
And the regulatory bodies are understandably so are interested in understanding
how to regulate in this environment and this is no exception to that. So as Lars
mentioned here, I think this is a great thing. We're excited to partner and we will
work collaboratively with all regulatory bodies who want to go on the journey to the
transition to a software-oriented vehicle.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. The next question is service remains an issue with
appointments available weeks or even months out. Likewise supercharge (inaudible)
Page 6 of 20
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
become untenable at some locations. What concrete steps is Tesla taking to improve
the customer experience in these two key areas?
A - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, I'll take the service part of this question, Andrew. You can take the
supercharging part. We have seen an increase in service wait times throughout the
summer and a couple of things that have contributed to that based upon the
information that we had. The first is that and I think this is kind of this is not unique to
us is that the return to some sense of normalcy in a post-pandemic world has
happened I think more quickly than most people expected and what we're seeing
here is that the number of miles that people are driving has increased. There may
have been some demand for service during 2020 or in the early parts of 2021 that
customers put off and so there is a bit of a catch up that's occurring that has
increased demand for service.
At the same time in the macro environment here logistics, moving parts, sourcing
parts, has become increasingly more difficult, which is well known issue in the world
right now as well as challenges in the labor market and so that's kind of the
simultaneous increase in demand for service when the ability to supply that service
has been impacted for the reasons I mentioned. And so we saw an uptick, primarily
in Europe and North America and service wait times over the course of the summer,
and we've been working extremely hard since then to address this and we've seen
our wait times come down. So this is not the case in every location. But if you think
about it from regional average perspective, we are seeing improvements there.
We remain super-focused on adding locations and so over the last year we've grown
our physical footprint of service centers by 35%. We have grown our footprint of
mobile repair by over 40%. We're also adding staffing as quickly as we can in the
areas that are most impacted by the imbalance of supply and demand for service,
but I think the most important part about all of this is and we said this on calls before
the best service is no service and so we have been incredibly focused as a company
both on the initial quality of our vehicles and reliability of our vehicles. And we've
seen pretty substantial improvements in both of those metrics over the long term
and over the last couple of quarters.
So it is something that remains on our minds We monitor this very closely, but
hopefully that's a helpful explanation into the context in what we're doing.
A - Andrew Baglino {BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. And on the supercharger side, the supercharging team monitors congestion
and plans expansion to ensure customer experience with minimal wait times
alongside the growth in our vehicle fleet. While we certainly have work to do in
expanding capacity in some congested areas, average congestion on the network
has decreased over the past 18 months, nonetheless we're not standing still. We are
executing accelerating expansion plans globally, the network has doubled in the last
18 months and we are planning to triple it over the next two years and even so on an
individual site basis to combat existing congestion more quickly where it is isolated
and problematic, we expedite local relief sites, deploy mobile superchargers, and
Page 7 of 20
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
we try to introduce pricing strategies that encourage more off peak usage to avoid
the waiting.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much.
A - Unidentified Speaker
And just one thing to add on supercharging. If you haven't experienced our latest
iteration [ph] of battery packs that can handle fast charge rates in combination with
our 250-kilowatt charging stations is pretty incredible. And this is a really important
component to supercharging capacity because the faster you can charge the more
charge sessions that you can have on an individual post, the better the customer
experiences as you're going on a long-term journey because you're supercharging
times are lower. So this is a really important part of the strategy supercharging team
has done a great job rolling these out but it requires a combination of both the 250-
kilowatt charging and our latest iteration of battery packs.
And we've also maintained an ongoing roadmap on software improvements
dynamic routing to avoid busy superchargers that's actually really helpful. We take
the real-time business of the stations into account when choosing where to navigate
people on their road trip. I mean beyond that, we're also continuing to improve the
trip planner itself and how it estimates how much energy people use. So it's not too
conservative and (inaudible) charge more than they need to which is another thing
that can delay total trip.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is this considering any other ideas,
other than FSD with the real world AI that can bring additional software[ph] revenue
to Tesla. If not can Tesla consider building interesting games around FSD beta?
A - Unidentified Speaker
Sure. On AI day we did talk about potential future where Dojo could be used as a
neural net training platform for other companies. It's not a focus of ours today as we
are fully subscribed on Dojo with our internal uses. We do expect to continue to
improve the in car experience in the context of FSD.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Great, thank you. And maybe last question from shareholders is how does FSD take
rate -- how has FSD take rate changed since introduction of monthly subscription.
Are there any plans to increase the FSD pricing as wider release becomes imminent?
A - Unidentified Speaker
I'll take the second part of the question first and we won't be providing any forward-
looking commentary on our pricing strategy or what may happen here over the near
term. With respect to the first part of the question it has been an interesting theme
Page 8 of 20
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
for us to impact within the company. I mean what I'll say just as a general statement
before I make a couple of specific comments is that the things that we learn on FSD
subscription today are not necessarily all that relevant. This is really more of a
platform for when FSD beta goes into wide release and the features and functionality
become more accessible to more customers.
The second thing that I will note is that if you look at the pricing, the monthly pricing
of FSD subscription and then you compare that to the cost of either rolling FSD
option into your lease or your loan on a monthly basis the most economical way for
customer to enjoy the features of full self driving is through purchasing it upfront and
enrolling into their financing and as a result of that what we've seen in the data is it is
not -- we're unable to detect a change in the upfront take rate of FSD when people
purchased cars. We have seen quite a bit of activity of folks curious to experience
what the software has to offer and subscribing to it and enjoying it to that route, but
again as I said at the beginning I think what we've seen so far on FSD subscription is
not terribly relevant. We'll see how that plays out in the future as we continue to
release more features.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much and now let's go to analyst questions. I just wanted to remind
everyone to click on the raise hand button. If you want to ask a question. The next
question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Pierre, feel free to
unmute your mic and go ahead. Pierre, I think your mic is muted. Okay. While Pierre
works on that let's go to the next analyst. The next question comes from Joseph Spak
from RBC. Joseph, we cannot hear you. Can you click unmute?
Okay, well the -- the team is working on that, let's just go back to set[ph] of
questions. So the next set of[ph] question is can Tesla allow for FSD to be transfered
to another vehicle at a fee something less than 10-K early adopters, are paying the
price if they want to upgrade their vehicle, you lose the value on the trade, the trade-
in and now you have to buy in at the higher cost.
A - Unidentified Speaker
I don't think that this is widely known, but (inaudible) doing the sentiment of what
this question is asking if you trade in your Tesla to Tesla there is a difference in price
that we pay for a trade in that has FSD compared to one that doesn't. And so there is
that premium that we pay to repurchase the FSD that money can then be applied
towards the purchase of a new car. So I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit. We
see it on social media. We see it in the forums et cetera and so this already does
exist. Not directly in the form here and we don't call it out explicitly in the trade-
in[ph] potentially that we have increased the price of your trade and as a result and
hopefully this clears this up because we do actually do that.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay. And the next question is Elon said that we get an update on cybertruck in
November a year ago but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of
updates. Will you show off the new and improved cybertruck?
Page 9 of 20
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Elon Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks, Martin. We get a lot of questions on cybertruck. We've been busy
detailing the cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers
a while back. As you may have seen recently on social media we've built a number of
alphas and are currently testing those to further mature the design and while those
point out a few key additions like (inaudible) also a number of smaller or less visible
improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial vision. We'll continue
to work through the product and the beta stages that we're in now and look to
launch that later next year.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay, thank you very much. We just promoted Pierre (multiple speakers).
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
Can you -- can you hear me, guys.
Q - Unidentified Participant
Yes, we can hear you.
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
Amazing. I'm very impressed that you managed to figure those.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Thank you, Pierre.
Q - Pierre Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
I would (technical difficulty) anyway let me ask you my question, actually I'm very
intrigued by what you guys are doing on the insurance front and so you have now in
the market in Texas and insurance products, for which the premium varies as a
function of the safety score of the driver and so I'd love to hear you about that you
must have some initial data points so that market reaction, you know, what is the
update and from there, can you tell us about how do you think you're going to
distribute[ph] that, is that going to go through your installed base very easily or is it
going to be like a heavy marketing push and then maybe tell us about your
expansion plans, what are the next geographies what's the timing, how fast is that
business line likely to grow in the next few years.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah. Thank you, Pierre. I'm extremely passionate about our insurance product. We
have a terrific team here at Tesla of folks who have been spending a lot of time
developing this and probably listening to the call. So we're pretty excited so far
Pierre. So I mean at the highest level here. We entered the insurance market kind of
unintentionally I would say. Our customers are coming to us complaining that the
price of traditional insurance was too high and it was reducing the affordability of the
Page 10 of 20
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Tesla and part of our journey here at Tesla is we want as many people as possible to
be able to afford our products. That's extremely important to achieving the mission
of the company.
And if you look at the price of insurance as a percentage of what somebody's
monthly payment is it's quite high and we spend extreme amounts of effort in
manufacturing to take $5 of BOM[ph] cost out here or $10 out somewhere else. If we
can get $5, $10, $20, $30 dollars out on a monthly payment you can calculate what
that means in terms of reduction of the price of the car. If you finance it and the
leverage of improving insurance cost is huge in terms of affordability and so that's
kind of the context by which we stepped into this.
As we started to do more research essentially the tools by which the insurance is
traditionally calculated are optimized based upon the existing data, but the existing
data is limited. So therefore there is a focus on things like marital status or age or
other attributes like that, accident history is a good one et cetera. What essentially
happens here is customers who are low risk and don't actually file many claims and
are overpaying on their insurance relative to their cost that overpayment then goes
to riskier customers who are essentially being subsidized. And as we looked at this
and we looked at the data, we thought this just doesn't seem like it's fair. At Tesla
because our cars are connected, because they are essentially computers on wheels
there is enormous amounts of data that we have available to us to be able to assess
the attributes of a driver who is operating that car and whether those attributes
correlate with safety.
Because we do get a signal when a car has been in an accident. So we've been
spending our time looking at hundreds of different variables and also looking at
billions of miles of driving history and we've been able to find[ph] a model that is
able to predict with decent accuracy the probability of collision over a period of
time. And the model is not perfect, the model is a function of the data that we have
available. That data set continues to grow. We continue to experiment with new
variables, but we do have a model that works pretty well so far. And from that model
being able to predict frequency of collision we can then align that against the price
curves.
And we can have individualized pricing integrated into the car, integrated into the
app, integrated into that customers' experience where the feedback go[ph] back to
the customer on how they're driving after every drive. The attributes that they were
successful on or unsuccessful on and the tips of things that they can do to improve
their safety. So that's what we have developed. We then included safety score as part
of the FSD beta enrollment program where we have almost 150,000 cars currently
using the safety score and I believe the latest data is over 100 million miles of
driving. So we've been able to go back and analyze that data and we've learned two
things coming from that.
The first is that the probability of collision for a customer using safety score versus
not is 30% lower, it's a pretty big difference. It means that the product is working and
customers are responding to it. The second thing that we've looked at, is what is the
Page 11 of 20
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
probability of collision based upon actual data as a function of a driver safety score
and that is aligning with our models, most notably here in the top tier of safety
compared to lower tiers there is multiple X[ph] difference and probability of collision
based upon actual data. So this is a very new and very exciting frontier for us. I know
that was long-winded but we spent a lot of time on this and we have put a lot of
thought into it.
Specifically with respect to the rollout, the insurance industry in the US is intensely
regulated and it's regulated on a state by state level. That means that we have
acquired regulatory approvals from each individual department of insurance at each
individual state. Texas is the first state that we launched in, I do want to thank the
Texas insurance regulators here, you've been great to work with. We have a roadmap
of additional states we will launch the product in their states, as we receive
regulatory approvals and our goal is to be in every major market in which we have
cars[ph]. The -- we did a soft launch in Texas last week. Yeah, and what we're seeing
an initial take rate[ph] data is that, if you compare that to what we're seeing in
California, we're off to a good start here. So we're very excited about it. We're
excited about individual risk-based pricing. We're excited about the ability for folks
to become safer and as a result, save money and it feeds into our priority of the
company of building the safest products in the world.
If I can add that, it's really exciting for the engineering team to the finance team
taking on safety (inaudible). Thanks for that guys.

Perfect. So, Zach as you noted, you hit low teens operating margins. That was your
medium-term target. You're there now despite the number of challenges and not full
utilization, sort of the plan. So how are you thinking about that target now and does
it allow you to drive price down further and[ph] lot more demand invest in other
initiatives or does that target need to change and then longer term, do you have an
aspirational gross margin target as the mix of software and hardware changes?
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah, we have achieved. We've actually exceeded our long-term guidance on our
operating margin target. So we're very pleased to see that And as we look out over
the next quarter and the next year there's a number of puts and takes financially for
the company. The launch of Austin and Berlin, will have ramp inefficiencies there for
some period of time until we get those factories up and running and so that's likely
to put some downward pressure on our margins as those factories ramp. Our goals
are to ramp those as quickly as possible. But, as Drew mentioned earlier, there are
number of unknown unknowns that we'll need to work through.
We are kind of also in this uncertain environment with respect to cost structure, so
we are seeing cost increase on the commodity side. We're getting feedback from
our suppliers as we are seeing ourselves, the impact of labor shortage and then
logistics and expedite cost just continue to be a part of our story here and it's
uncertain how that will unfold. It's our hope that these things stabilize exactly when
that happens is difficult to predict and we have been adjusting pricing in line with
those changes in cost and so we'll see how that unfolds over the course of the next
year. So it's difficult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons.
With respect to operating margin we've been very focused as a company on
managing our overhead expenses and operating expenses and operating expenses
as a percentage of revenue has been declining and I expect that trend to continue to
happen, and I think the net of all of this is hopefully that we continue to make
progress on operating margin over the next four or five quarters. As we think can
afford[ph] the business up until this point, it's largely been a hardware automotive
business with a little bit of software on top of that. As full self driving matures as take
rates increase if we are to raise pricing on that there is considerable upside both on
gross margins and operating margin as that comes delayed.
As the business starts to become more of a mix of hardware-based company and a
software-based company. So we feel optimistic about the journey very optimistic
about the journey. As we look over into the long-term. Just a little bit difficult over
the next four to five quarters, we'll continue to update on earnings calls as we learn
more information. There's just a lot of uncertainty in the world right now.

Yeah. The second question is just you mentioned LFP[ph] globally for standard range
models my understanding is that all comes from China is that the continued go
forward plan or do you want (technical difficulty) LFP abilities and other factors[ph]
around the world.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, certainly our goal is to localize all key parts of the vehicles on the continent, at
least the continent, if not closer to where the vehicles are produced. So that is our
goal and we're working with internally and with our suppliers to accomplish that
goal and not just at the end assembly level but as far (inaudible) as possible.
Operator
Thank you very much. And the next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells
Fargo. Colin are you able to unmute? Okay. While we're waiting for that let's go.
Q - Colin Langan {BIO 15908877 <GO>}
Oh, sorry. Do you hear me now.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Sorry, yes, we can hear you now. Perfect
Q - Colin Langan {BIO 15908877 <GO>}
Okay. Yeah, I was just actually kind of following up on the question before. You
mentioned commodities are rising and when I look at a lot of the key raw materials
in the battery cobalt, nickel, lithium all up 40% and I know you guys have done a
good job of getting long-term contracts and sort of mitigate that impact, I mean
have you seen so far any impact from that spike and if not I mean, any sense of when
that raw material headwind might actually show up or has shown up.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, we have seen an impact. Our primary exposure right now is around nickel and
aluminum. Nickel in the cell, aluminum in non-cell and we have a mixture of
contracts with various suppliers and some materials we contract directly and we have
full exposure to price fluctuations. We do have a number of long-term commitments
and long-term contracts in place. We also have contracts where there is some
amount of cost sharing based upon the movement of the indexes and as these have
been moving some of those costs have been flown through to us. It's not a
substantial amount of cost, but it's not small. As we look towards the next year I
certainly hope it doesn't play out as way but it's possible that we continue to see
more of cost headwind as a result of these movements. It's difficult to say precisely
but the volatility and the increases are so substantial and there are certain suppliers
that maybe up to a certain point have been absorbing some of the increase and as
contracts expire there where we have to renew and extend them we'll have to return
to negotiations.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
And so what we have to do as a company and what we are intensely focused on is
we need to be continuing to drive down the cost of our products which we have
been doing and we have to overcome cost increases that are outside of our control.
So whether that's resourcing components or redesigning components or finding
ways to be more efficient in manufacturing we have no choice but to continue on
that path and be even more aggressive in the light of the macroeconomics here.
Q - Colin Langan {BIO 15908877 <GO>}
And diversification, right. It doesn't need to be nickel or cobalt or I mean there's
always another option.
Operator
Thank you. Colin, do you have a follow-up question. Okay. Let's go to the next one.
The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Hey guys, can you hear me okay?
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Yeah, we can hear you
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Perfect. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy around anode materials and your
ability to leverage that into reduction on the cathode side performance from
(technical difficulty).
A - Unidentified Speaker
Sure. I don't know that I'm going to get into too many specific's but I guess first one
thing I would say is unlike the commodities discussion we just had like the anode
materials are not really in the same situation just in terms of what the considering
components are so there is less of focus on like rapidly changing them one way or
the other because they're generally stable commodities. There isn't exactly like a tit
for tat or like get a better anode useless cathode like that there is a fundamental ratio
that you need to maintain for the cell to function. So I guess zooming out the primary
focus on the anode side that we have is just ensuring that it doesn't in any way that
we were able to continue to reduce the cost of the anode without impeding on the
long-term cycle -- cyclability of the product. It can also help with energy density as
you like sort of improve the energy density of the anode and improve the energy
density of the cell not directly one to one, because you have to pack more cathode
in as the anode gets better and that gets a focus as well but the trade space is just
sort of cycling versus day one cost.
Q - Colin Rusch {BIO 15823117 <GO>}
That's super helpful. And then just around the vehicle pricing strategy obviously
there is a lot of flexibility there for some customers or not. Can you just talk a little bit
Page 15 of 20
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
about the process around vehicle pricing and how quickly you expect to change that
and adjust as you see some of these commodity prices flow through the cost
structure and you look at (technical difficulty) dynamics for vehicles.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah. Pricing has been a really difficult thing for us over the last couple of quarters
and part of the -- part of the challenge is the great thing that we're seeing in the
space right now is there appears to just be quite a profound awakening of the
desirability for electric vehicles and I mean totally frank it's caught us a little bit off
guard and that kind of awakening and change in consumer sentiment, I'm sure
there's lots of reasons that go into it. But folks want to buy an electric car and folks
want one of our Tesla right now, it's very exciting for us.
At the same time we have installed capacity to build more cars, but more
constrained by a number of dynamics as we've talked about in great detail and we
are putting an extreme effort to build as many cars as we possibly can. It's hard to
overstate how extremely efforts are. It's quite a grind. We're trying as hard as we can
to maximize that capacity and to be able to meet the demand that we're receiving
but the net-net of all of this is that we're not able to increase production capacity fast
enough so that at the same time we are seeing macro economics, cost impacts on
our structure as we've discussed previously on the call.
So we're trying to think through, if somebody orders a car now it will -- it could be
delivered in some cases and depending upon the car in which factory could be
couple of months, could be a couple of quarters and the timing in which we build
that car will be just before that car gets delivered and what the world look like at that
point and so we're trying to think through how the cost structure is evolving, has
pricing you need to change with that, what are the supply dynamics in the space.
The other thing that I'll just note on pricing is that company has changed pricing all
the time. The difference is that when Tesla changes pricing it's extremely transparent
where that's not always the case otherwise and sometimes our pricing will increase
sometimes our pricing will reduce sometimes to the public our pricing changes may
not seem to make logical sense, but there is a strategy that we work behind the
scenes as we're balancing supply and demand as we're also trying to balance
various shortages on parts as we're trying to manage wait times. All of that goes into
the optimization here.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yeah, we can hear you.
Page 16 of 20
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Q - Brian Johnson {BIO 7256455 <GO>}
Yeah, I know. By the way great to hear. There is a team at Tesla, not just a one person
show. I want to drill down a bit more on FSD. In December of 2020 in a business
insider interview in Germany your leaders said that he expected level five autonomy
by December within a year so that would be now. Yet we look at the progress in FSD
and some of the issues you see on YouTube and it looks very much like a Level two,
two plus system that requires vigilances in-fact your disclaimer side. So I guess three
questions kind of one, what is the timetable to get to level four at least capability we
can be able to regulatory stuff later and two, what is the criteria for Zach for you to
release revenue -- deferred revenue around FSD and it's having a Level two system
that needs monitoring enough to release that deferred revenue and then three,
maybe you could talk a little bit more about how you plan to work with the new --
with the folks who appear to be asking some questions they have three request out
to you regarding information around the level two around new capabilities
(inaudible).
A - Unidentified Speaker
There are lot of things, we will take them in order. It's difficult to be specific on the
timelines. The (inaudible) is working extremely hard iterating on every version. We
are being extremely transparent through the release of this to public customers who
are posting information online. So when you're using for self-driving and you're
going through the iterations you can feel the progress and for those who don't have
it in their cars social media is excellent getting a sense for how that's progressing
and the team is moving quickly with every iteration, with every update and they're
working very hard on that.
On your second question about the criteria to release deferred revenue the way that
this works is we have made certain commitments as to what this product can offer at
the time that a customer has purchased that. And so what we have to assess is we
made those commitments and is the software widely available to folks that we've
made those commitments to within a certain geography and given that FSD is still
currently in the beta phase, it's invitation-only and it's limited. We have not deemed
that to be appropriate for recognition of deferred revenue and will continue to
evolve this, will continue to monitor it within the finance team to see when we get to
the milestones in which we're comfortable releasing.
On the (inaudible) question, Lars do you want to take that.
A - Lars Moravy
Sure, I mean as I said earlier, we always cooperate fully with nets[ph] and other
regulatory bodies in any sort of investigation they may have particularly related to
ADAS systems when they came out with withstanding general order in July. We were
quick to respond to that and one of the first and only company is capable of actually
meeting the needs of that report. We continue to send that information through
them as required weekly as sales[ph] occur and with the additional investigations as I
said with great sincerity and we'll work through them one by one. To make sure that
Page 17 of 20
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-20
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
all the facts come out and is well informed about our strategies for both active safety
in this case, but also passive safety.
As you guys may know, we released updates to our (inaudible) last week to Model Y
using our fleet data. We will work closely on[ph] that and they were fully in the loop
before we did it. So I think these kinds of things will continue to happen in the new
regulatory space as Zach discussed as we move towards a software-based vehicle
and we were happy to be a part of that journey
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. The next question comes from (inaudible).
Q - Unidentified Participant
Two[ph] very good quarter. I had two quick questions. So first is regarding the two
upcoming factories in Berlin and Austin, who are the two factories, different from
each other. Maybe in the layout design assembly lines. And the second question is
related to Cybertruck, who is the supply looking at, if you look at the exoskeletons
steel is the supply for that material sufficient for immediate ramp up, I'll say, in '23,
'24 time for Cybertruck. That's all from me.
A - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, So obviously, as we've noted in the past, we developed our own stainless steel
grade for the exteriors cybertruck to meet both the durability corrosion
requirements -- required for an automotive world[ph] with this raw material and
others as Joe mentioned, we continue to look at multiple sources and we have made
some early sourcing decisions in that, but I think we'll keep that one internal and
we've already began the first (inaudible) different from any other material, just about
how hard the rollers are to get to that hardest level and just like every manufacturing
process we put in for every new vehicle will work with our suppliers and vendors to
make sure those timelines and supply meet the need and demand of our customers.
And on the differences between Austin and Berlin. There are some. They are largely
associated with the different sort of building architectural choices that happened to
occur in collaboration with local codes and other sort of governing requirement that
drives the differences in the architecture between the locations. In general they are
like we're trying to progress the manufacturing system as a system and make sort of
logical like path to find improvements from factory to factory and in some cases
there was an improvement identified between like decisions for one Austin, Berlin, or
vice versa. And so there might be a slightly newer iteration of one part of the factory
in one place than the other but it's all part of like a path forward in the factory that
builds machine, the machine that builds machine, sorry.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. And the last question comes from Jed Dorsheimer from
Canaccord.

Q - Jed Dorsheimer {BIO 6360573 <GO>}
Can you hear me.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yes, we can hear you.
Q - Jed Dorsheimer {BIO 6360573 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. So, Brandenburg I'm just wondering, Zach if you
could estimate the carry costs from a margin perspective. All right. I guess in two
parts. So when do you expect do you still expect production coming on in '21. So a
couple of months left in December and how do you see that margin impact as a
function of the carry cost and I do have a follow-up question.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Sure. So it remains our target in both Austin and Berlin to be able to build our first
production curves before the end of the year. We've talked about this a bit. The
unknown unknowns, new factories, new vehicle designs, new technologies, new
locations, new teams. So there is quite an execution journey ahead of us. But that
remains our target and all of our plans are oriented around that. We should not
expect for us to deliver cars by the end of 2021 from these factories, even if we do
produce some, so Homologation regulatory reasons. And we'll want to make sure
that we build up some number of cars that we're confident in the quality and the
customer experience around them.
The second thing that I'll say and I mentioned some opening remarks is because of
the newness here it's extremely difficult for us to be precise in what the ramp will
look like. And it's possible things -- the stars align and things move quickly as
possible that we're spending the bulk of next year, working on ramping these
factories and it's just very hard to say. And we'll continue to update you all three of
these calls and through other forms. As to how that impacts our margins that is also
difficult because that is a function of the ramp which is uncertain. So the benefit here
which is different in the ramp of these factories, compared to other factories is if you
think about the percentage of our total cost structure in any given quarter that is
associated with new ramps.
We have the Fremont factory that's running, generating stable and growing margins
there. The same is also true in Shanghai. So I expect we'll see some amount of
headwind on margin from these ramps. It's just entirely dependent on how quickly
we're able to ramp and what uncertainties come up during the process.
Q - Jed Dorsheimer {BIO 6360573 <GO>}
Sure. So on a margin per car, but I would suspect, though if your carry cost is full rate
now on that as you start producing vehicles. It's going to be a margin lift from where
you're at right now.

Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
We are carrying some amount of cost associated with the factories today and so the
incremental cost associated turning the factories. It's not 100% of the factory, if that's
what you're getting out in your question.
Q - Jed Dorsheimer {BIO 6360573 <GO>}
Yeah, that's what I was getting at.
A - Zachary Kirkhorn {BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yeah. We also actually saw very similar dynamic to this when we are launching Model
S earlier in the year. So when a product starts launching and then cost of goods sold
starts to activate depreciation starts to activate, there is a bit of a movement in the
P&L as to where that cost resides. So, assuming to some extent Brandenburg and
Austin costs are already flowing through our P&L, but we still need to continue
staffing and ramping and incurring all the operating costs associated with the factory
that we're not spending right now.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}

again in the three months. Thank you very much, and goodbye.
