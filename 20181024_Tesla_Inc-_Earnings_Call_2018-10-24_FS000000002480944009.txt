MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Tesla Q3 2018 Financial
Results and Q&A webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at
that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Martin Viecha,
Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Viecha, you may begin.
Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's third quarter
2018 Q&A webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, JB Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and a

number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 1:00 PM
Pacific Time in the update letter we published at the same link as this webcast.
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking
statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of
today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
During the question-and-answer portions of today's call, please limit yourself to one
question and one follow-up. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening
remarks. Elon?
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Thanks, Martin. So I'll make some opening remarks, and then we're going to talk
about vehicle safety, autopilot and factory safety. And we have a number of people
from Tesla here to elaborate on that. I think there's just a lot going on that you would
find interesting.
But I want to start by thanking all of our customers, employees and shareholders.
This was an incredibly historic quarter for Tesla. Model 3 production stabilized. We
delivered a total of 84,000 vehicles globally, which is more than 80% of the vehicles
that we delivered in all of 2017.
In fact, we delivered more cars in this quarter than we did in all of 2016 in a single
quarter. Model 3 became the best-selling car in the U.S. in terms of revenue and the
fifth best-selling car in terms of volume. We saw higher revenues and significantly
better profitability in our energy business. In fact, I think for solar it may have been
the best quarter ever for solar.
We achieved GAAP net income of over $300 million, increased cash and equivalents
by $731 million, and achieved a greater than 20% gross margin for Model 3. And,
moreover, we expect to again have positive net income and cash flow in Q4. And I
believe our aspirations I think will be for all quarters going forward.
I think we can actually be positive cash flow for all quarters going forward, leaving
aside quarters where we may need to do a significant repayment; for example, in Q1
next year. But I think, even in Q1, I think we can be approximately flat in cash flow by
end of quarter.
This quarter was made possible by the incredible execution of our employees across
the board, from sales, production, delivery, service, energy, engineering, finance and
all of our G&A teams. Really every part of the business executed incredibly well. I
want to thank everyone again for your incredibly hard work. I especially want to
thank customers who helped.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
It's like – I've never even heard of this. Maybe this has happened before, but I've
never heard of a case where a company's customers actually cared about the future
of the company so much that they volunteered their time to help the company
succeed. I think that's amazing. You don't see that anywhere. So, yeah, it really
chokes me up actually.
This quarter, we started rolling out Version 9 of our software, which is our biggest
software upgrade in two years. And Model 3 received a five-star safety rating in every
category and subcategory. And it got the lowest probability of injury of any car that
the U.S. government has ever tested.
Looking ahead, we expect to produce and sell even more Model 3s in Q4, and
expect that trend to continue into Q1. And we're excited to bring Model 3 to Europe
and China early next year, given that the market for midsize premium sedans in
those regions is even larger than in North America.
I've said before that we must prove that Tesla can be sustainably profitable. This
quarter was an important step towards that and I'm incredibly excited about what
lies ahead. So this is, yeah – just so proud of the Tesla team, our customers. Really
appreciate the support of our long-term shareholders. And I just want to say on
behalf of the Tesla team, we're super appreciative of your support to what has
actually been a really difficult time.
All right. Now, let's start off with the vehicle safety. Madan, who's our lead vehicle
safety engineer; been with the company for a long time. Madan, how many years has
it been that we've been working together?
Madan Gopal {BIO 15428791 <GO>}
It's my 10th year. 10 years.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
10 years. Wow. So, yeah, I've been working with Madan for 10 years. We've had so
many conversations on vehicle safety. Wow. And you know what, we're really going
to try to go the extra mile with vehicle safety, not just – like there's a series of
government mandated tests, but what some companies do is they game the system.
So they know where the side pole impact is going to be. They strengthen it right in
that position. At Tesla, we're like, okay, what is the weakest point in the car? Let us
test it at that position. So the actual safety is not fully captured in the test because we
anti-game the system.
Madan, if you could?
Madan Gopal {BIO 15428791 <GO>}

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Thank you, Elon. Just want to give you a very quick background about myself. Like I
said, joined Tesla 10 years. I'm extremely really happy to mention working with
extraordinary set of very passionate and very hard-working individuals, and that
essentially shows in our product. So that's very important for us.
And also important is our principal mission statement on safety, because what we
want to do is, safety has been – is probably the important factor for our vehicle. It's
not just for electric vehicle; any vehicle period. And that fundamentally differentiates
us, which essentially helps us to keep adding new features and new safety
technology. And that's very important and that shows in Model 3; latest things that
we have.
Also, the fact that we have electric vehicle, the design and architecture gives us a
fundamental benefit over traditional vehicles. And that takes care of, for example,
whether you have a block of engine in the front, where we can work with using pretty
much open architecture in the front and the whole fact that you have all the electrical
and high-voltage and motors and all of that almost below the center of gravity of the
vehicle gives lowest probability to produce a lower risk. It significantly benefits.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, I think architecturally we have Newton on our side. And having Isaac Newton
on your side is definitely the way to go.
Madan Gopal {BIO 15428791 <GO>}
Exactly. So in the latest series of tests, I would like to specifically talk about Model 3.
Alexa did a series of tests, actually four tests, for one front door, two side and one
rollover test. And if you look at it, we've been calculating how can we distinguish
within the five-star. There are so many vehicles that already gets five-star. And if you
look at within the five-star.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
They're just all the same. They're all the same.
Madan Gopal {BIO 15428791 <GO>}
Exactly. So if you look there, there is a metrics we came up with which is a part of US-
NCAP rating itself, has the lowest probability of injury, and Model 3 has the lowest.
And just to give you a context, there are total of 900-plus vehicles since 2011 which
have been rated. So the fact that Model 3 is the best among all the 943, to be exact.
So that speaks to volume. And I'm very happy to say that Model 3 has achieved.
We are not stopping right now. What we would like to do next is how we can make
use of the active safety and autopilot features and make it even more improvement
so the next area that we are focusing on how to integrate active and passive safety.
That's our next area of challenge, which we will improve for sure.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Regarding that the safety extends to not just people in the car, but also
pedestrians.
Madan Gopal {BIO 15428791 <GO>}
Correct.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. So not having a big engine block in the front of the car is really helpful simply
because if the car were to hit a pedestrian – we'll get to active safety next, because
the best thing is obviously not to hit a car or a pedestrian. The fact that the hood can
dent so far in is really helpful, because it ends up being sort of like a trampoline, or
like a – you don't have a rock underneath it. It's very helpful. So it's helpful for
pedestrian safety and for the safety of the people in the car.
And then, even if you have like a head-on collision with another car, the extended
sort of crumple zone of a Tesla Model S, Model X or Model 3 is helpful to the people
in the Tesla and the people in the other car. So it's not just the people in the car.
Madan Gopal {BIO 15428791 <GO>}
I'd like to add one item, which is essentially how we look at real-world safety, which
has always been an important for Elon. So if you look at our block post, we showed
how we handle the center pole impact in the frontal. By the way, that's not part of
NCAP rating. It is just to show how we go over and above the NCAP rating to make
sure it's real-world safety. Yes. That's very important for us.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Exactly. That's what I meant by we, like, anti-game the system. Like, what is the worst
way that the car could be hit? Not just sort of strength where we know this test will
happen and that kind of thing. So, obviously, we're all in these cars, our friends are in
these cars, our families are in the car, so we care about safety. And a lot of people
think safety is boring, but not Tesla.
So thanks, Madan.
Madan Gopal {BIO 15428791 <GO>}
Thank you.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}

FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Thank you for your decade of hard work and the rest of the safety team. And with
that, let's move on to autopilot. And you guys could just give an update on sort of
autopilot software, AI and hardware. Yeah.
Stuart Bowers {BIO 20627575 <GO>}
That's great. This is Stuart Bowers. We will soon begin to roll out the team's most
advanced autopilot feature ever, Navigate on Autopilot. In our last release, we
launched a new set of neural networks that, combined together, provide a view of
everything happening around the car. With Navigate on Autopilot, we'll use
information to understand exactly where the car is on the highway system and to
automatically change lanes, handle forks and take high-curvature exits to follow a
map route.
Initially, it will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn signal before
the car moves into an adjacent lane. Future versions will allow customers to waive
the confirmation requirement if they choose to.
One area that I'm personally really excited to build on this improvement is active
safety. With the advancement in neural networks covering 360 degrees of view
around our car, we can provide a level of constant vigilance that humans just can't.
Ultimately, this shall allow us to warn or even intervene for an enormous percentage
of modern accidents and to ship these improvements as software upgrades to our
existing customers.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We see this all the time in the data, where the car will do an automatic braking event
and save a pedestrian or another car from impact. This happens all the time.
Stuart Bowers {BIO 20627575 <GO>}
All the time.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, all the time. Usually, every day but very briefly.
Stuart Bowers {BIO 20627575 <GO>}
Yeah. The team has done an incredible work here. And by bringing up more of the
cameras around the car, we can detect things as they come toward us, not just
directly in front of us.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.

Stuart Bowers {BIO 20627575 <GO>}
Pete?
Peter Bannon
Hi. This is Pete Bannon. The hardware 3 design is continuing to move along. Over the
last quarter, we've completed a qualification of the silicon and qualification of the
board. We started the manufacturing line and qualification of the manufacturing line.
We've been validating the provisioning flows in the factory.
We've built test versions of Model S, Model X and Model 3 in the factory to validate
all the fit and finish of the parts and all the provisioning flows. So we still have a lot of
work to do, and the team's doing a great job. And we're still on track to have it ready
to go by the end of Q1.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Great. And that'll be on roughly a 1,000% increase I trust and capability compared to
the current hardware. And so, it's obviously a giant improvement despite being
about – it costs about the same. Cost volume and car consumption are
approximately the same as the current hardware, but it's a tenfold improvement in
frames per second. And improved redundancy as well.
But very important to emphasize is that the only thing that needs to change between
a car that's produced today and a car that's, say, produced in the second quarter of
next year is swapping out the autopilot computer. And this is a simple change that
takes less than half an hour in service to upgrade the computer. And so, anyone will
be able to upgrade their car to full self-driving capability with a simple service visit.
So we expect all cars with the hardware to sensor suite. Basically, anything made in
the last, roughly, two years will be upgradable to full self-driving.
Peter Bannon
Yes. In fact, a lot of the cars we're using for testing today have, in fact, been
upgraded from hardware too.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Right. So it's very important to emphasize, like people shouldn't wonder who would
want to wait until that comes out. But there's no need to wait until that comes out
because it's just a very simple plug-and-play change to get to full self-driving. And
anyone who's paid for the full self-driving option will just get it done for free. And
anyone who still wants to order full self-driving at this point, it's just an off-menu item.
You can still order it, but we took it off the order menu just because it was creating a
lot of friction in the sales process and people didn't understand the difference
between enhanced autopilot and full self-driving.
Page 7 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
So just to simplify the order process, we took that off, but anyone who asked for it
can certainly get it. And it really ends up being a discount on future capability. But to
be clear, there's definitely no need to wait until Q2 to order a car. We want to make it
just a completely seamless process, so there's no advantage ordering now versus
Q2.
Andrej, do you want to...
Andrej Karpathy {BIO 20228714 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely. Hi, everyone. My name is Andrej Karpathy. I'm the Director of AI
here at Tesla, and my team trains all of the neural networks that analyze the images
streaming in from all the cameras for the autopilot. For example, these neural
networks identify cars, lane lines, traffic signs and so on.
The team is incredibly excited about the upcoming upgrade for the autopilot
computer, which Pete briefly talked about. This upgrade allows us to not just run the
current neural networks faster, but more importantly it will allow us to deploy much
larger computationally more expensive networks to the fleet.
The reason this is important is that it is a common finding in the industry – and we
see this as well – is that as you make the networks bigger by adding more neurons,
the accuracy of all of their predictions increases with the added capacity. So in other
words, we are currently at a place where we've trained large neural networks that
work very well, but we are not able to deploy them to the fleet due to computational
constraints.
So all of this will change with an acceleration of the hardware and it's a massive step
improvement in the compute capability. And the team is incredibly excited to get
these networks out there.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. And I've said this before, but I think I was talking a bit about the
kind of longer term future. We absolutely see the future as sort of a shared electric
autonomy, so that you'll be able to do ride-hailing or share your car in any way, sort
of long-term model that's probably some combination of like Uber, Lyft and Airbnb.
In other words, there'll be Tesla-dedicated cars for ride-hailing and any customer will
be able to share their car at will, just like you share your house on Airbnb.
So it's the combination of those two models, I think, is pretty obviously where things
are headed long-term. The advantage that Tesla will have is that we'll have millions
of cars in the field with full autonomy capability, and no one else will have that. So I
think that will end up putting us in the strongest competitive position long-term.
And then, Laurie, can you finish it off with the talk about factory safety? And thank
you for the hard work of you and your team, and I think we've made great strides.
Page 8 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
And, yeah, please go ahead.
Laurie Shelby
Yes. Thanks. Yeah, we have the safest cars made by the safest people. So it's exciting
time here at Tesla. All car and manufacturing factories have injuries. At Tesla, we have
a commitment to zero injuries and our target is actually on good reporting. So we
have good reporting of injuries, good reporting of near misses, good observation
and lots of improvements. So to be the safest company in the world, we have to be
committed to that; and everybody here is. So we're actually steadily getting there
and we're not going to stop till we're there.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Absolutely. So you were mentioning like, for example, we have some sort of, for
example, we do get these like quite unfair accusations. For example, one of them
was like that we were under-reporting injuries, and it's worth noting that OSHA
completed their investigation and concluded we have not been doing anything of
the sort.
Laurie Shelby
Correct. Correct. The factory here had a four-month long Cal/OSHA investigation
and it basically proves that we are recording properly and doing as we should be. So
it's much different than what you would read about in the press.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, this is true.
Laurie Shelby
Yeah, yeah. I'm very proud of the team for that. One point I think people don't know
is, I've been here about a year now. Time flies when you're having so much fun.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Feels like 12 years.
Laurie Shelby
I know. But when I joined, we were already really a fraction – our injury rate was a
fraction of what it had been when Toyota and GM ran the factory in the newbie days.
So what we're all about is really continuing to make improvements from there. And
what's also important is not to have serious injuries, and that's extremely rare here at
Tesla. We have really strong focus on prevention and also mitigating controls so that
these types of injuries don't occur. I mean, most of the injuries that we have are
muscular sprains and things like that.
Page 9 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. So essentially it's muscle strain and getting scratched. That's most of it.
Laurie Shelby
Exactly. Hand and finger cuts and sprains. So I kind of just want to break down a few
things that my team is been working on along with all the leaders here. First, it's
people engagement. So one of the first things is meeting with you, Elon. We meet
with you on a regular basis. We meet with all the production leaders. So it's full on
engagement on improving safety. We have built a really strong EHS team, the best
and the brightest.
And our EHS team is actually embedded into the line on the factory because we
learn the process and we learn the people. You don't know how to improve unless
you're out there on the line, on the process, engaging with the associates, listening
and learning from our associates.
So we have really strong engagement, health and safety committees. We do find it,
fix it walks. Our leaders are out there walking and also looking for improvements.
And actually just this quarter, we had over 15,000 improvements. I mean, that's like
amazing. So very exciting about that.
We also look at risk reduction and human performance. People are going to make
mistakes, so we're going to design in so we fail safely. We have an Early Symptom
Intervention program. This is where we have industrial athletes go out on the line
and work with our associates before anything happens. Like if you have a pain, let's
work it out, let's strengthen and really get our employees fit. So we're doing that.
We've also just opened a new and improved health clinic, so when injuries do occur,
we get the absolute best care for our associates. And it's actually overseen by one of
California's leading orthopedic surgeons, and we did that because most of our
injuries, like we said, like 80%, 85% are either sprains and strains. So now, they get
that best care here on-site. And we have 24/7 care. It's actually staffed by three full-
time doctors and nurses, and I'm really super happy with the care they're giving and
I think the employees are as well. And the third...
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, we're going to expand on that, so Tesla's sort of health clinic both at Fremont
and at Giga. We have a really immediate first-class healthcare available right on the
spot when people need it. And this is not just for workplace; this is for workplace
and non-workplace.
Laurie Shelby
I know, that's super exciting. We're (23:03) the world.
Page 10 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, if you become injured or ill for any reason, then there's healthcare immediately
outside.
Laurie Shelby
That's where we plan to go. Exactly. And then, finally, just being proactive because
that's what we're about, innovation and proactive. I mean, we join national safety
organizations, we partner with many leading universities including California
Berkeley, Center for Occupational and Environmental Health. We do presentations
there. We work with the automotive industry and do benchmarking all the time.
We're always looking and bringing people in to look for things that we can do better
and for new technology and innovations and safety.
And with all of that, we have made improvements in our injury rates, we are more
than 10% better year-over-year in our lost workdays and our days away, but the most
important thing is we're also getting all those good engagement observations,
they're moving up. So injuries down, observations engagement up.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
All right.
Laurie Shelby
Thank you.
Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Thanks, Laurie. And we will provide regular updates on workplace safety. And our
goal unequivocally is to have the safest factories in the world, where people look
forward to coming to work in the morning. So it's like, yeah, that's our goal.
All right. With that, can we move to questions?
Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Cool. Well, thank you very much. And, Sherry, let's go to the first question, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.
Page 11 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Q - Daniel V. Galves {BIO 16540648 <GO>}
Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on the quarter. It's really
amazing to see this landmark quarter after covering the company for so long. And
thanks for bringing some of your team onto the call. It's very interesting. My question
is about cell supply. There has been some noise about tight cell supply and sparks
and tight labor supply. In the short-term, could you just talk about whether demand
is outpacing supply of battery cells and kind of what's your plan for long-term
expansion, including cell supply in China?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
JB, do you want to take that?
A - Jeffrey B. Straubel {BIO 16619298 <GO>}
Sure. I can speak to that. This is JB. We have had a period where the supply was fairly
tight for Model 3, but it did not really constrain the Model 3 production in any
significant way.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, like for a week.
A - Jeffrey B. Straubel {BIO 16619298 <GO>}
Yeah, maybe for a few days.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Jeffrey B. Straubel {BIO 16619298 <GO>}
The impact was larger felt on the energy products. And that still is somewhat tight,
but we do, as we pointed out in previous discussions, we do have third-party
supplies of energy cells. So that production can continue even independently of the
Panasonic supply in sparks. So that's been very helpful. And that is expanding in
future quarters. And also, the Panasonic supply is expanding. The productivity of
existing lines is continuing to improve with a lot of hard work from the engineering
teams and just operational stability. And we continue to bring online new production
lines.
So even just in the last several weeks, we've started off yet another cell production
line with Panasonic. And through the end of the year, there's another line coming on,
and then one shortly after that. So there's a steady increase in the total supply that
should keep us ahead of even Model 3 growth and also should let us have a larger
percentage of energy supply be sourced from Giga, locally.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Page 12 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Yeah. We are making a pretty nutty amount of the world's lithium-ion batteries. And,
Martin, I think we're about a 60% or something...
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Yes. So at the moment, if you'd look at, for example, for Q3, all electric vehicles made
around the world, their total battery capacity was about 20-gigawatt or 19-gigawatt
hours; and what we produced in Q3 was about the same or a little bit higher. So
about half of world's batteries basically.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, that's because we also saw cells from Japan and elsewhere. Is that (27:13)...
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Yeah. So just the Giga itself is about 20 and on top of that S and X is, I don't know,
another four or five ?
Q - Daniel V. Galves {BIO 16540648 <GO>}
Got it. No, it's a huge advantage. Is there plans that you can talk about for cell supply
in China? Will that be produced in China? I'm assuming so.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Long-term, it would be produced in China. Short-term, we are not certain of the
short-term situation, but long-term certainly.
Q - Daniel V. Galves {BIO 16540648 <GO>}
Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you. Let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.
Q - Pierre C. Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
Hey. Thank you for taking my questions. I was very surprised with the numbers you
reported today by – that your gross margin performance on the Model 3. So if I
remember correctly, you were expecting more like a 15% target margin for this
quarter and you actually did better than 20%. So can you take us through what
improved like faster and better than you had initially anticipated in the
manufacturing line and where these improvements came from?

Deepak here, and Jerome and others, please feel free to join. Our improvements on
the cost side were in every aspect of costs. So, clearly, our manufacturing labor hours
improved significantly. Our overall manufacturing costs dropped almost 30%
sequentially Q2 to Q3. We produced more volume, so we had better fixed cost
absorption. We had far less scrap. Our yield on each of the lines across both
factories improved significantly. And as we look forward, we see even more
opportunities. We are going through this phase where we are now stabilizing
production, and the team can now intensely focus on cost optimization. And that
trend will just continue in Q4.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. I think we're also being relatively on the conservative side when we predicted –
when we said like 15%, we were being...
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Right. Our expectation was we would do better, but we want to be conservative.
You're right in terms of our guidance that we gave for Q3.
Q - Pierre C. Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks. That's great. And then, as a quick follow-up, you've announced over
the weekend like a mid-range car with a smaller battery bag. And I was wondering as
you are looking at expanding collection of the Model 3. I think about it as you have
two options. One was to grow and to keep producing higher and higher ASP cars;
and the other one was to go forward – lower-cost car and stick to the U.S. So how did
you decide the sequencing of these two things? Why is lower car now and going
abroad only early next year?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, we try to provide the most affordable electric car options that we can. And
since we can't – we just don't have the ability to get to the $35,000 car right away,
we thought this might be a way to offer it as an intermediate step. And that's really it.
We expect to start producing at significant volume for Europe in January. And
obviously take some time to ship, so deliveries – pretty significant deliveries in
Europe kind of in the late February, March timeframe because cars have to ship away
from California to a customer in Europe. And for us, a car only count as delivered if it
reaches the end-customer and all the paperwork is completed correctly. So it's the
highest possible standard for considering a sale a sale.
Q - Pierre C. Ferragu {BIO 15753665 <GO>}
And also to the APAC you'd start delivering cars.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, but, we may or may not deliver cars in APAC in Q1. But certainly in Q2. It will be
kind of borderline as whether a car is delivered in APAC by the end of Q1. So I can't
say it for certain. Definitely in Europe. But, and then, definitely in APAC in Q2.

Okay. Let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.
Q - Romit Jitendra Shah {BIO 16865852 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you. I guess just along those lines, you indicated that you're going to
bring Model 3 to Europe early next year. Where would you like to see production in
order to support that ramp overseas?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, initially production will occur. I mean, in the next several months all production
is, vehicle production will take place at our car plant in California.
Q - Romit Jitendra Shah {BIO 16865852 <GO>}
Sorry, I meant to ask where would you like to see that production rate on a weekly
basis go to in order to support that ramp?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, it's hard to predict with accuracy. And there's also – like all the tariff wars and
everything. So long term we are not talking about next quarter. So like what it is likely
global demand for Model 3? It's probably on the order of anywhere from 500,000
to 1,000,000 cars a year, I'd say, good global demand for Model 3. If you look
something like say the 3 Series, Martin, that's around 0.5 million.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
0.5 million.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The BMW 3 Series is about 0.5 million a year globally. And generally, we find that we
outcompete the BMW 3 Series quite well. So it seems like logical, therefore, that we
would want to have a higher production – or higher demand. Maybe it's somewhere
between the – kind of the BMW 3 Series and the Volkswagen Golf, which is about 1
million units a year. So yeah, that's right. It's anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million units
a year long term.
Q - Romit Jitendra Shah {BIO 16865852 <GO>}
And do you have to add new lines to support that, or are – just going to continue to
remove bottlenecks in the existing lines?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Page 15 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
No. We're definitely going to do local production in China. We are moving rapidly on
that. So we're striving to have Model 3 production for the China market, for the
Greater China market active certainly next year; it will be happening next year. But it
will be done with – in a very capital-efficient manner. Much more akin to the way we
did general assembly line four versus general assembly line three. And then we will
also have a factory in Europe long term because it's pretty silly to make cars in
California and ship them all the way to Europe that's far.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Especially in high volumes.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, exactly. Especially if it's a – I'm not talking about S and X; I'm just talking about
the Model 3. So S and X will continue to be made in California. I think probably
exclusively here. But for cars we're trying to maximize affordability, it makes a lot of
sense to produce those cars at least in the continent where they are consumed
(35:18)
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Okay. Let's go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from George Galliers with Evercore.
Q - George Galliers {BIO 21095133 <GO>}
Thank you. Maybe just following up on the previous question. Is the target still to
produce 10,000 Model 3s a week in Fremont? And I think you mentioned in the past
that once you got to a run rate of around 5,000, you'd be better placed to assess
what CapEx is required to get that. So as of today, do you have a better idea of what
CapEx is required to get to that kind of level at Fremont?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think we're not prepared to speak to that right now, except that it will be
considerably less than money that we spent to get to 5,000 in the first place, like
quite – I think quite dramatically less. So I like probably see a path to like 7,000 units
a week for Model 3 with really minimal CapEx.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Very minimal.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, very minimal to get to 7,000 a week. And then that's really just basically slowly
improving the uptime of the existing lines and we can do 7,000 a week.
Page 16 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Exactly.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So – and then it gets a little harder as we start to go above 7,000. We need to at least
bring lines down in Fremont for significant upgrades to get to 10K, but also just not –
we're not talking about massive amounts of CapEx. But I would say like long-term,
it's – again, long-term, it's – predicting things on a quarter by quarter basis is very
difficult because when you have an exponential growth rate like we do – I mean if
you look at Tesla cumulative deliveries over time, that's like the cleanest exponential
curve that I've ever seen.
So – but small movements in calendar time can look like a very large hit or miss, one
way or the other, because it's such a steep curve. That's why it's always tricky to
predict things on a quarterly basis. But a lot easier if you go out a year or so. Yeah. I
mean probably long term, it's at least sort of 7,000 to 10,000 cars from Fremont of
Model 3 and then – I don't know – 5,000 to 8,000 in rest of world. Something like
that. This is a guess.
Q - George Galliers {BIO 21095133 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, in the letter you do point out that the
size of the European market for premium midsize sedans is roughly twice that of the
U.S. Could you also maybe just comment to what your expectations are for mix in
Europe based off Model S and Model X? Do you expect richer mix in Europe versus
the U.S. or is it fairly similar?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We've given that zero thought. I mean, it's just like it's not – I have no idea. I don't
know. Martin, do you have any idea?
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
No. All I'm aware of is that because of cold weather, probably all-wheel-drive and
long battery range will be highly demanded in Europe, but apart from that – we
ultimately have to start selling the car to see what the demand is, so.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, it seems like it's likely to be comparable to – pretty much midsize sedans market
is like twice as big in Europe, then – well, it's likely to be at least as much demand in
Europe as there are in North America. Like, that's a pretty safe bet. But our goal really
is to make electric cars that everyone can afford, not to sort of mine high option
value cars. It's like if we could produce the $35,000 car today, we would do it. We
need more work. There's more work to do before we can make a $35,000 car and
have it be part of the gross margin. We're probably less than six months from that,
but that's our mission.

A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Great. Let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Macquarie.
Q - Maynard Um {BIO 1972683 <GO>}
Hi. Thank you. Congratulations on a great turning point for Tesla. As you continue to
scale the business, can you talk about how we should think about how you balance
profits versus reinvestments? You're targeting sustainable GAAP profitability and
cash flow, but I'm curious if there's a level of GAAP profitability or GAAP operating
margin or cash flow you want to hold and then take the excess to fund new growth
or accelerate opportunities?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. Maybe to characterize that question would be like are we starving new vehicle
development in order to achieve GAAP profitability and cash flow positive? Would
that be an accurate – is that essentially – the answer is no. So we've made significant
progress on the Model Y, so in fact, I approved the prototype to go into production
recently. So it will be 2020 before that's in volume production, but we made great
progress there. Also continue to make progress on the semi and the newer Tesla
Roadster. And then actually product I'm personally most excited about is the Tesla
pickup truck.
I think that's going to reach some next level stuff there. And I should not forget to
mention the solar tile roof. We'll also start getting into volume production of the
solar tile roof next year. That's quite a long development cycle because anything
that's roof has got to last 30 years. So even if you do accelerate lab testing as fast as
possible, there's still a minimum amount of time required to do that and there's a lot
of engineering that goes into how do you put on the solar tile roof and not be really
labor-intensive in doing so.
So there's a lot of engineering, not just in the tile but in the way it's done. And then
we've got continued improvements in Powerwall, Powerpack, other energy products.
I think we've got the most exciting product roadmap of any company on earth by far.
I'm not even sure like probably twice – I don't even know who would have – which
company would have a better product roadmap or even close. Maybe they do but I
don't know about them.
Q - Maynard Um {BIO 1972683 <GO>}
Great. And when you talk about Tesla having its own ride sharing fleet or giving
people the ability to loan out their car like an Airbnb model, I'm curious if your long-
term plan is to build a platform that's going to enable companies to write
applications to turn the car directly into an application. And then can you also maybe
just talk about that business model? Should we be thinking more about like a
Page 18 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
revenue sharing model sort of like how Apple takes a piece of revenue generated
for applications from iPhones? Thanks.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I don't know about turning the car into an application exactly, but I mean, maybe. But
I try to do the thing that maximizes usefulness, and so if there's a way where third
parties could do something, then that could make sense. But I do know for sure that
Tesla will operate its own ride hailing service. We'll compete directly with Uber and
Lyft, obviously, and but then also have the ability for customers to offer their car and
add or subtract their car to the fleet at will. There will be a company-owned fleet and
the company-owned fleet will just be where there aren't enough customer cars to be
lent out.
So if we find a particular metro there aren't enough customers who are willing to add
their car to the shared fleet, then that's where we'll supplement it with a Tesla-owned
fleet. So that's why it's sort of a combination of the Uber/Lyft thing and Airbnb and
then we would charge something probably comparable to how the App Store works
or I don't know, we'd charge 30% or something in order for somebody to add their
car to the fleet. I think that's like a pretty sensible way to go. Yeah.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Great. Let's go to the next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
Q - Adam Michael Jonas {BIO 3339456 <GO>}
Thanks, everyone. First question is on governance. As the company conducts its
search for a new Chairman, what are the attributes and experiences of that person
that you think would be a best fit or best value for Tesla?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Actually, on this call we're going to restrict questions to operational topics. Do you
have another question?
Q - Adam Michael Jonas {BIO 3339456 <GO>}
No problem. Yes, I do. Can you tell us about the folks who are taking deliveries of
Model 3? What are the top cars, car models or brands that they're trading in or
switching out of? How many are new to the brand? Anything you're prepared to
share, and then I have a follow-up.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. Absolutely.
Page 19 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Hey. This is Martin. So I've done the analyses of all the trade-ins that we've received
and really the only pattern that I've seen is that it sort of all across the board and the
vast majority is non-premium brands. I think that is the number one message is just
that more than half of the trade-ins we received were priced at below $35,000 when
new. But other than that, there is no real pattern. I haven't noticed anything worth
highlighting other than it's just a lot of people upgrading their cars quite
dramatically.
A - Operator
Which is a huge upgrade.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. For most people – well, maybe for most, but for many people it is the most
expensive car they've ever bought. So they're clearly demonstrating with their
money that they're willing to spend extra money to get a Tesla. So Tesla seems like
mass-market premium.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
The price lock is way beyond the Federal tax credit. So clearly there is value on top
of what they're receiving whether it's cost of ownership or the sustainability, whether
it's the brand or the source. (46:37)
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Safety.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
And safety. All of the above is making a large number of customers jump up
significantly in the purchase price.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Again really I could say, honestly, the top reason to refer a friend to buy Tesla is it's
going to keep your friend safe.
Q - Adam Michael Jonas {BIO 3339456 <GO>}
That's a good reason. If I can just squeeze in, since I couldn't ask the first one that
you could answer, do you think that the third quarter is a milestone, Elon, where you
think Tesla becomes sustainably self-funding and perhaps not in need of outside
capital? Thanks.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, that is our goal. We do not intend to raise equity or debt, at least that is not our
intention right now. That may change in the future, but the current operating plan is
Page 20 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
to pay off our debts and not to refinance them, but to pay them off and reduce the
debt load and overall leverage of the company. And I actually almost forgot one
quite important thing. This is quite helpful, why it's helpful to have these sort of crisis
situations with logistics, for example, as I look into the inventory, like basically finish
part inventory from factory to the customer, I was quite surprised to see how long
that took and that it was quite expensive in a lot of cases to get the cars to
customers.
This was something I didn't fully appreciate before and we really have a major
initiative at Tesla to get the average time from a car exiting the factory to receiving a
check from the customer or being in the customers' hands, just to be clear we only
get the check when we give the car to the customer. So getting a car from factory to
customer to get that to be as short as possible.
In August, the average time in North America to get a car from the factory to the
customer was 30 days, which is embarrassingly long. By the end of the quarter, we
had reduced it to around 22 days and our goal in Q4 – this is a goal, not a promise –
but our goal is to get the average time of a car from the factory to the customer
under 10 days. This was a giant improvement in the capital efficiency of the company.
Because we're making on the order of $75 million worth of products per day, of cars
per day, so every day it requires $75 million worth of capital. So every 10 days it's
$750 million. And, obviously, we have a loan from the bank that we can make use of,
but the banks will only loan us 85% of the cost of the vehicle, which translates to
about 70% of the price of the vehicle.
And then, we've got this loan outstanding, which effectively increases the COGS of
the car. And it dilutes the company to the tune of 30% of whatever the inventory – of
the finished goods in transit is. So this is really like tightening that and getting that
below 10 days in North America and then also improving dramatically the transit time
to Europe and Asia. This is where having local factories is actually very important for
the capital efficiency of the overall system, because I think over time we want to get
the time from a car going from factory to customer under 7 days worldwide. And
then, the terms that we have from our suppliers are on average just over 60 days.
Now, our parts inventory management also there's a lot of room for improvement
there, but I think we'll probably cut that down to a few hundred million dollars or so,
Deepak, something like that. Maybe $200 million or $300 million of parts at the
factory. So effectively, what we're going to do is reverse the working capital
requirement for the company quite dramatically to the point where the faster we
grow, the more capital we have. This is incredibly important for capital efficiency of
the company. It's night and day.
Deepak, is there anything you'd like to...
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
No. I think we are totally – we are reducing our raw material inventory on one hand
by keeping the production stable, finding efficiencies in warehouse management
Page 21 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
and supply chain, and at the same time reducing the time to deliver the car and
convert that car into cash, and that significantly improves working capital leads.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, it's really quite dramatic. So yeah, I think it sort of profoundly changes the
financial effectiveness of Tesla.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
We reduced our inventories in Q3, which helped. And although we had higher
receivables because the quarter ended on a weekend, we won't have that in Q4. So
all of this should continue to help us in Q4 and beyond, the working capital game.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, it occurs to me that even if the only thing – even if this was the only
thing that Tesla did different was to shorten the time from factory to the end
customer, and any given company that did that would out-compete all other
companies over time. It would not be a contest.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Great. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi {BIO 21226758 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you. I have one for Deepak and then a follow up, please. Deepak, the
OpEx expense management was very strong in the quarter. I think it was down 13%
sequentially and OpEx was only up 5% year over year, despite revenue growing 71%.
So on that front, I mean, in hindsight, did you get too bloated and needed to get
more rightsized? And looking forward, how do we think about OpEx growth versus
revenue growth on kind of a more normalized basis?
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Yeah, Toni, so excluding onetime items, our OpEx decreased sequentially by 5%, to
just clarify that, first of all. And a lot of that was driven by the actions we took in Q2 to
be more efficient with our employee head count, how we benefited from that in Q3.
And we were really careful in terms of all of our spending.
The other piece that helped us is a lot of our Model 3 spending on expensed sort of
R&D is reducing because Model 3 is going into production, so Q2 to Q3 we saw a
reduction there. And it just gives you the sense of the leverage our operating
expenses can have, while our revenue is growing dramatically. So our OpEx will
increase in the future, but at the far slower rate, and we will continue to be really,
Page 22 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
really careful about the spending. And I think there're actually more efficiencies that
we can find.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We already find them. Absolutely.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Right. So we'll continue down that path.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Definitely.
Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi {BIO 21226758 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you for that. And then to follow up, I was just wondering if you could
help us a little bit on the – back to the gross margin on Model 3 and the $35,000 car.
So this quarter, I impute that Model 3 ASPs were maybe $59,000, and that might
suggest that gross margins on a $35,000 Model 3 might be about zero. And Elon, I
think you alluded to the fact that the goal is really to get positive gross margins on a
$35,000 car before shipping. Are those all fair assessments? And I guess the
question is where would a $35,000 Model 3 be in terms of gross margins today?
And where does it need to be before you want to offer it broadly to consumers?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The challenge with answering questions of that nature in detail is that it is a rapidly
changing situation. So literally, if you had asked us in a month, it would be different.
Another month, it would be different. There's no question we need to get to a point
where we can sell a $35,000 car and where the full accounted for COGS of the car is,
let's say, on the order of $30,000 or slightly less than $30,000. So I think we'd want
to ideally get the COGS of the car, of that configuration of the car, under $30,000.
That's our goal. That's what we're pushing very hard to achieve.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Exactly. And it's a matter of time. It's (56:32-56:43) there's a significant material cost
reduction that comes. You have a smaller battery packs, or a fewer amount of cells.
It's not the same cells that we have in the existing cars.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, it's the same cells, but it's not the same.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
The same amount of cells. Cell cost.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Page 23 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
It has fewer cells in it, and then the non-cell portion of the pack is also cost-reduced.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Exactly.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
With the current mid-range pack, it still has basically about the same non-cell portion
of the pack cost.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Exactly. And we are achieving massive reduction in all of our manufacturing cost per
car, which will continue. And as volume grows, that also helps us lift fixed cost
absorption. So it's the same factors that have helped us so far will continue to help
us going forward, to get us there. Anything you want to add, JB? No?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
A - Daniel V. Galves {BIO 16540648 <GO>}

A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Thanks.
Q - James J. Albertine {BIO 17420845 <GO>}
Wanted just a point of clarification, Elon, you mentioned in August the time to get
the car from the factory to a customer was 30 days down to 20 at the end of the
quarter and your goal is under 10 by the end of 4Q. Where do we see that flow
through from a COGS perspective? Is that in automotive gross margin? Or was that
in services and other at this point?
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
It's all in automotive gross margin, our logistics costs are found.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Page 24 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Outbound logistics.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
In COGS are found in automotive.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think we'd see a reduction in inbound logistics as well as outbound logistics. Maybe
the question is, for the debt that is carried for that period of time, is that getting into
COGS? Or is that not...
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
The interest expense...
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Of the debt that's in the interest expense line. That is not in COGS.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay. Yeah, that's like, anything like the difference in COGS should probably be
important to include anything that's directly driven by volume essentially. That affects
the marginal cost of the vehicle. So although that is not officially in COGS, in my
opinion, it probably should be. It's to take the ABL interest expense and apply that
effectively to the cost of the car.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
And from a broader sense, you're looking at it as the cost of doing business which
can be avoided.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, essentially cash flow ability increases quite dramatically, dilution or leverage
outside of the ABL line improves dramatically and then the de facto cost, the
effective cost of the car also reduces because you do not have the interest expense.
If you have the interest expense over 22 days versus 10 days it's a big difference.
Q - James J. Albertine {BIO 17420845 <GO>}
Understood. And I appreciate that clarification. Sort of what I was trying to get at,
you've been running a negative gross margin in services and other for the past
several quarters now, and wanted to get a sense for when that could maybe drop
and start to turn a corner and to generate some profit for you? I understand there's a
lot of building out going on for sales, service, and charging infrastructure. But if you
can give us some kind of clarification there, that would be I think helpful. And if

you're willing maybe to provide an update on where you stand today in terms of
battery costs? I know your goal of parity with ICE vehicles, but maybe an update if
you're willing to provide and where you stand in that trajectory. Thanks.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
I think over time every quarter progressively we will see an improvement in the
service and other business as our revenue continues to grow and as the size of our
fleet grows, it's as simple as that.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, long-term I would expect the service to be a significant revenue item and to be
a positive margin contributor. And it's going to be a function of our fleet size.
(01:00:41)
Exactly. We're under warranty. There's a lot of stuff that's under warranty, but as the
warranty expires so there's non-warranty items then we would expect service to
positive gross margin.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
Yeah, and that also includes our used car sales.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, a good point.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
And our used car sales is continuing to grow and they have a healthy margin. And so
that overall business for mature companies is in some cases more profitable than
new products. I'm not just talking about OEMs, car part OEMs. And we are at the
early stage of our growth here and as our fleet size grows, there are just so many
opportunities in that business, but it's a matter of time, simply said.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
And on the battery cost, there was a question?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, that is a key sort of competitive metrics, so I think it's safe to say we are much
better than anyone else by a lot. But we prefer not to give a precise number.

Okay. And now let's go to the last question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Phil LeBeau with CNBC TV.
Q - Phil LeBeau
Thank you, guys. Elon, quick question. In terms of as the federal tax credits starts to
be phased out as your sales crossover the threshold, what kind of an impact have
you guys modeled into how much that might slow down potential sales?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We don't expect this to result in – I mean, yes, the sales tax or the tax incentive in the
U.S. drops in half at the end of this quarter, but then we also start shipping to
Europe, and then start shipping to Asia and we certainly do not expect anything that
would cause our productions to drop below let's say a minimum of 5,000 cars a
week.
Q - Phil LeBeau
But in terms of in the United States, do you expect that it will slow down demand and
sales within the U.S.?
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think as we are able to offer lower cost versions of the car, we would expect
demand to sustain in the U.S. But I want to be clear, it's not like we're holding back
this lower-cost version of the car intentionally. Just like with is there anything we can
do to provide a lower-cost car now and that's where we came up with the
depopulated long-range pack, it's just like basically taking, having long-range pack
with fewer cells.
We really care about providing the end customer with the most affordable car that
we can possibly produce, the best viability, and if we could do the smaller pack now
we absolutely would, it's just is going to take us, I don't know, at least three months
to get the production going and (01:03:39) our production. And then that
production's going to go to – we've got to make packs, the packs got to go to the
vehicle factory, the cars have to get delivered to customers, so that's why customers
probably see the smaller battery pack on the order of March or something or
February maybe, but it's something on that order.
Q - Phil LeBeau
Okay. Thank you.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
And one thing, these do trigger kind of maybe points that are worth bearing in mind.
As our quarterly letter indicates, the Model 3 is the most efficient energy per mile
Page 27 of 29
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-24
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
electric vehicle out there. It's got the best efficiency, so we've got the best in terms of
miles or kilometers per kilowatt hour and we also have the lowest cost per kilowatt
hour. This makes it very difficult for other companies to compete with Tesla, because
we are the most efficient car and the lowest cost of batteries.
So I do encourage our competitors to really make a huge investment, and we've
been saying that for a long time, and then they're only in this competitive
disadvantage because they didn't – we tried to help them as much as we could and
they didn't want to take our help, so they can use all our patents for free. They can
use our supercharger network if they can just have an adapter for our connector or
something.
We want to be as helpful as possible to the rest of the industry, but the fact of the
matter is we made the investment in the Gigafactory and other companies didn't,
and we put a lot of effort into having extremely efficient cars, having the most
efficient powertrains and the other companies didn't, but I'm sure they will over time,
but that's what has put us in quite a strong competitive position right now.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Fantastic. I think that's all we have time for today. Sorry, go ahead.
A - Deepak Ahuja {BIO 15935173 <GO>}
I'm just going to add a comment in closing, and Elon started with it and I wanted to
say that from myself personally here, I want to personally thank all the Tesla
employees that have worked incredibly hard this quarter and in prior quarters in
each and every part of our business. Our results really are a reflection of the
execution done by the company and the passion that our employees have to deliver
such results despite all odds. And I also want to thank all our customers and all our
investors who have believed in us, in our product and our vision of us leading the
world's transition to sustainable energy. So thank you from my side.
A - Jeffrey B. Straubel {BIO 16619298 <GO>}
No, I'm good.
A - Elon Reeve Musk {BIO 1954518 <GO>}
All right. Anybody have any additional comments or anything? All right. Thanks,
everyone. And, yeah, look forward to the next call. Thanks.
A - Martin Viecha {BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you, goodbye.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does
